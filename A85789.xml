            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>HOw gracious the Lord hath been to the Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in giving to her pure Ordinances, we truſt ſhall be acknowledged by us whileſt we live, with thankfulneſs to the Moſt High, of whom we deſire mercy and grace to adhere unto the Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline and Government e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed in this Land: Amongſt the many ſad tokens of the Lords Indignation againſt this Church, The preſent Differences of His Servants of the Miniſtry is looked upon by us as one of the greateſt: And as we hold it a duty to be deeply humbled before the Lord in the ſence thereof, and by all lawful and fair means within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of our power and ſtation to endeavor the remedy thereof; ſo we do ackdowledge a free General Aſſembly, lawfully called, and rightly conſtituted, and proceeding with meekneſs and love in the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, according to the Rule of the Word, and the Acts and Conſtitutions of this Church, to be amongſt the firſt and moſt effectual means appointed of God, for attaining this end, and for preſerving the purity, and advancing the power of the Work of Reformation in this Age, and tranſmitting the ſame to our Poſterity, and to the Ages and Generations that are to come. But as the faithful Servants of God in this Church in former times, did by His good Hand upon them in the right adminiſtration of free and lawful Aſſemblies, bring the Work of Reformation in <hi>Scotland</hi> unto a great perfection, and neer conformity with the firſt pattern: So, unfaithful men minding their own things more then the things of Chriſt, and uſurping over their Brethren, and over the Lords In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, did deface the beauty thereof, firſt by encroaching upon the liberty and freedom of Aſſemblies; afterwards by taking away the Aſſembly themſelves. Therfore, remembring the many bonds and obligations that lie upon us before the Lord, and being deſirous to be found faithful in this day of temptation, and to exoner our

conſciences as in His ſight, and to avoid acceſſion to that guiltineſs in which many have involved themſelves, and conceiving that this preſent Meeting is not a free lawful Gen. Aſſembly of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in regard that the Election of Commiſſioners to the ſame hath been pre-limited and prejudiced in the due liberty and freedom thereof, by a Letter and Act of the Commiſſioners of the laſt Gen Aſſembly ſent to Presbyteries appointing ſuch Brethren as after conference remain unſatisfied with, and continue to oppoſe the Publick Reſolutions, to be cited to the General Aſſembly; And in regard that Commiſſioners from many Burroughs and Presbytries are abſent, as wanting free acceſs, by reaſon of the motion of the —; and in regard that many of the Commiſſioners of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Aſſembly, who have carried on a courſe of defection, contrary to the truſt committed to them; and who in their Remonſtrances and Papers have ſtirred up the Civil Magiſtrate againſt ſuch who are unſatisfied in their conſciences with their proceedings, and who have by their Letter and Act prelimited the Aſſembly, are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſit and vote as Members of the Aſſembly, and their Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor appointed to be Moderator of the Aſſembly, notwithſtanding that timous exception was made againſt them, that they ought not to be admitted as Members of the Aſſembly, until their proceedings were firſt tried and approven by the Aſſembly; And in regard that his Majeſty by his Letter, and his Majeſties Commiſſioner by his Speech to the Aſſembly hath incited to hard courſes againſt thoſe who are unſatisfied in their conſciences with the proceedings of the Commiſſion.

or ratifying of the proceedings of the former Commiſſion, not only becauſe of their want of juſt power and authority ſo to do, but alſo becauſe theſe proceedings contain many things contrary to the truſt committed to theſe Commiſſioners, eſpecially the allowing and carrying on of a conjunction with the Malignant party, and bringing them in to places of Power and Truſt in the Army, and in the Judicatures, contrary to the Word of God, the Solemn League and Covenant, the Solemn Confeſſion of Sins and Engagement to Duties, the conſtant tenour of the Declarations, Warnings, Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances, Cauſes of Humiliations, Letters, Supplications and Acts, and Conſtitutions of this Church, and the laying of a Foundation for the Civil Magiſtrate to meddle with Miniſters in thoſe things which concern their Doctrin and the exerciſe of Miniſterial Duties before they be cited, tried and cenſured by the Judicatories of the Church. And we proteſt that whatſoever Determinations, Acts, Ratifications, Declarations, Sentences, Cenſures or Commiſſions that ſhall be made, or given out by them, may be void and null, and may be interpreted as binding to the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that notwithſtanding thereof it may be free for us, and ſuch as adhere to us, to exerciſe our Miniſterie, and enjoy the warrantable Chriſtian liberty of our conſciences according to the Word of God, the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Covenant, and Solemn League and Covenant, and Solemn En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement to Duties, and all the Acts and Conſtitutions of this Church; and that there may be liberty to chuſe Commiſſioners, and to conveen in a free lawful General Aſſembly, when there ſhall be need, and the Lord ſhall give opportunity, and to add what fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reaſons ſhall have weight for ſhewing the nullity of this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, and the unwarrantableneſs of the proceedings of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the former Aſſembly.

And now for the point of proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Cui libet licet proteſtari ſupplicare mendicare,</hi> as the common proverb goes: But it is moſt remarkable that the Lord by theſe legal means of Proteſtations hath preſerved in all times of Defection and houres of darkneſs (as betwixt 1571. and 1575. betwixt 1582. &amp; 1587. betwixt 1597. and 1638.) the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> from a total and univerſal back-ſlyding and breach of Covenant, and ſo from His Wrath and Judgment againſt the whol, but keeped ever a remnant in Covenant with Him and Him faſt to Them, and thereby they keeped God in the Land; and the Lord in all times of their reviving and recovery of light and life made their ſucceſſors, as it were, enter heirs by theſe Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the Intereſts of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> in God, and His Intereſt in Her, and ſo hath He made us in our two Covenants and ſolemn Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment <hi>per ipſa verba,</hi> to be, as it were, ſerved and retoured to all the former Proteſtations; And who knows what ſucceſſors may be to theſe that are now neceſſary? It is worth remembring at this time, that in the Gen. Aſſembly 1586. when they were drawn on by the Kings Court to abſolve M. <hi>Patrick Adamſon,</hi> that <hi>Mr. Andrew Melvin</hi> and <hi>Mr. Andrew Hunter,</hi> in the name of the whol Synod of Fife, entred their Proteſtation againſt it, as before the Almighty God. His holy Angels and Saints, that ſeeing he had given no real ſigns and evidences of true Repentance, they had no aſſurance in Gods Word, or in the ſincere cuſtom of this Kirk, and in conſcience to allow this his Abſolvitor, and therefore until the time they perceived his converſion to be true and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, they cannot but hold him a man juſtly delivered up to Satan; which is too like to the preſent receiving of the <hi>Malignant party,</hi> then in the Aſſembly 1597. when the King carries in it the Commiſſioners of the Kirk with caveats to have vote in Parliament: but <hi>M. Jo. David<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> entred his Proteſtation, ſo did ſome Miniſters at <hi>Perth</hi> in the Null-Aſſembly 1617, ſo did they in the name of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> give in a Proteſtation to the Parliament 1584. 1597. 1606. 1612. 1617. 1621. and 1633. againſt all theſe Procedors, to the prejudice of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſo they preſerved and tranſmitted by Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (which was firſt given in by our Reformers to the Parl. 1560.) unto this Generation 1638. and 1640. <hi>Jura Eccleſiae</hi> Scoticanae <hi>intacta in jure quamvis, frequentur violata de facto,</hi> which I pray God we may preſerve and tranſmit with as great fidelity and boldneſs to our poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:166443:9"/>
ſhould chooſe none to be Commiſsioners, but ſuch as did concur with the publick reſolutions. 2. An intimation of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsions mind, that Diſſenters from the publick reſolutions were ſo farre from being in a capacity to be choſen Commiſsioners, and to ſit as Judges of the matter in the Gen. Aſſembly, that they ought to be looked upon as guilty perſons, who were for their guiltineſſe to be cited and judged. 3. A Declaration that if they ſhould be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, they could not be admitted to ſit upon the Bench as Judges, but behoved to ſtand at the Barre and anſwer as <hi>rei.</hi> 4. That if the Presbyteries ſhould chooſe them, they were to be eſteemed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient, and looked upon as perſons having no reſpect to publick orders of the Kirk; which things do cleerly enough prove that there was ſuch a prelimiting of the election as is formerly ſpoken of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> The Commiſsioners of the General Aſſembly in the yeer 1648. did by a Letter written to the ſeverall Presbyteries, appoint ſuch Miniſters as refuſed to declare their judgement againſt the Engagement, which was then carried on, or did declare themſelves ſatisfied there with to be refered by their ſeverall Presbyteries to the General Aſſemblie, which upon the matter is equivalent to a citation; and yet was not that judged a pre-limitation of the freedom of the Aſſembly. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> To ſay nothing of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of a Reference and Citation, neither yet of the difference of a Letter and an Act: We deſire theſe things to be conſidered in anſwer to what is objected. 1. That in the yeer 1648. when a little before the election of Commiſsioners by the Presbyteries to the General Aſſembly; it was moved by ſome in the Commiſsion, that ſome thing might be written to Presbyteries to chuſe none but ſuch as were againſt the engagement; it was oppoſed as ſavouring away of pre-limitation, and ſo only a Letter was written, giving them an accompt of the Commiſsions proceeding, and exhorting them to their duty and to chuſe able and faithfull men. 2. That that Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which is mentioned in the objection, was not written by the Commiſsion (as we remember) untill moſt part, if not all the elections in Presbyteries were paſt, wil be cleered by the date there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. 3. That before the writing of that Letter, the whole Kirks of <hi>Scotland,</hi> almoſt in all the Presbyteries and Synods thereof had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared themſelves unſatisfied in conſcience with the Engaegment, excepting a very few Miniſters ſcatered here and there in Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which few were alſo known to have been either oppoſers of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:166443:10"/>
the work of God, or neutrall and indefferent therein from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining. 4. That the reſolutions of the Commiſsion were then agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Covenant and Act; and conſtitutions of former Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Aſſemblies, which things being put together make a vive dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt that which was then done, and that which the Commiſsion hath now done, becauſe the Letter and Act of the Commiſsion this year was previous to moſt part of the elections in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and whilſt many Presbytries were bearing teſtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Reſolutions, and the moſt part of the godly of the Land remain unſatisfied therewith, and many p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Objection.</hi> It was not only in the power of the Commiſſion to appoint thoſe who did oppoſe th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> publick Reſolutions, to be cited to the General Aſſembly, but alſo to have Cenſured them, becauſe there is a Clauſe in their Commiſſion which gives them power to Cenſure ſuch as oppoſe them in their proceedings, as if they oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Aſſembly it ſelf: and therefore ſeeing the Commiſſion hath been ſo far from excluding that they have keeped themſelves fair within the limits and bonds of that power given them by the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; it cannot be ſaid, That their Letter and Act doth import any prelimitation of the Aſſembly, or any prejudice to the freedom of Election, or any wrong to theſe, who were ordainned to be cited. <hi>Anſw.</hi> We deny that the Commiſsion had any power either to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or cite theſe who oppoſed the publick Reſolutions now in Controverſie. The clauſe of the Commiſsion in 1648. (to which we ſuppoſe theirs to be conſonant) is that all oppoſers of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Commiſsion in matters intruſted to them, ſhall be holden as oppoſers of the Authority of the General Aſſembly, but was never int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uſted to them to bring in the Malignant Party: nay, a great part of their Truſt was, to keep them out. But for further cleering of the buſineſs, we deſire that it may be conſidered, That as the light of Nature and common Reaſon teaches all ſuperior Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories to limit any to whom they give Delegations and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsions to a certain Rule, according to which they are to walk in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:166443:10"/>
their adminiſtrations, to wit, the known ſtanding Laws of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporations, to which the Judicatories do belong, and to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain end which they are to have before them in all their actings, to wit, The good and preſervation of the whole Body to whom they belong: ſo unleſs we will ſpeak groſſe abſurdities, it is undeniable, that the Commiſsion of the General Aſſembly were in all their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctings to have walked according to the Acts of former General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, and to have had before them the preſerving and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the work of Reformation, and the keeping of the Liberty and Priviledges of the Kirk intire and untouched, <hi>ne quid deure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti capiat Eccleſia</hi>: having been the main end why Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners from General Aſſemblies were at firſt appointed: but ſo it is that their Reſolutions and Proceedings in order to the taking in of the Malignant party were not only without the warrant of any Act of Aſſembly, and not only not contributive for the preſerving and advancing of the work of Reformation, but expreſly contrary to the clear Letter of the Covenant, and of multitude of Acts, and deſtructive to the work, and therefore had they no power at all ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Cenſure or Cite ſuch as did oppoſe them therein, and ſtand for the Covenant and Acts of the Aſſembly; and by aſſuming to themſelves ſuch a power they did not only beyond the bonds of their Commiſſion, but deſtroy the very end for which their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was given them, to wit, The preſerving the Liberties and Priviledges of the Kirk, for by this means they brought the Gen. Aſſembly it ſelf into ſervitude and bondage, by excluding all ſuch there-from as would not be conſenting to that courſe of Defection which they had carried on, a very dangerous and damnable prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative which laies a foundation, Firſt, for the total overthrow of the Diſciplin of this Kirk, then of the Doctrin and Worſhip: for by this means if the Commiſſion once be corrupted, though it were ſo far as to the introducing of Prelacy and the Service-Book; nay, though it were to the bringing in of the Popes Supremacy and the whole Body of Popery; there is no remedy left, none can vote in a Gen. Aſſembly where the remedy is to be expected, but ſuch as Concur with them in Judgment; others, who Differ and Oppoſe, are to be Cited and Cenſured.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> Albeit the Commiſſion did ſend ſuch a Letter and Act as is ſpoken of, yet it doth not from thence follow that thereby E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Commiſſioners in Presbyteries to the Aſſembly is prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:166443:11"/>
or pre-judged in the due liberty and freedom thereof. 1 Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was free to Presbyteries, notwithſtanding thereof, to chuſe whom they pleaſed. 2 A Citation to the General Aſſembly doth not bar a man from being choſen Commiſſioner thereto, nor exclude him when he is choſen from voting therein. 3 Becauſe that Letter and Act had little or no influence upon Presbyteries in the choice of their Commiſſioners, but notwithſtanding thereof ſeveral Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries did chuſe men who were unſatisfied with the Publick Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. 4 None who were unſatisfied with the Publick Reſolutions, and were Commiſſioners, were upon that accompt, of their not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſatisfied; or being cited, denied a Voice in the Aſſembly. <hi>Anſw.</hi> As to the Firſt, it is true, That Presbyteries were phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally free, notwithſtanding of that Letter and Act to chuſe whom they pleaſed, That is, the Letter and Act put no external coaction and conſtraint upon them by any coerſive power upon the outward man; but they were not morally free, that is, they were not free from a moral over-awing power, having influence upon their will, to wit, the authority of the Commiſſion, commanding them upon the matter to chuſe none ſuch, and upon the matter threatning them if they ſhould do otherwiſe. They were ſo far bound as the Commiſſion could bind them: and who knows not what influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the Direction and Commands thereof have upon Presbyteries to determine them in their actings. As to the Second, Though e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Citation, or Citations of all kinds, do not exclude a man from being choſen a Commiſſioner, or ſitting a Member of the Aſſembly, yet we think that it will not be denied, that a Citation in matter of ſcandal, either in Doctrine or manners, will, and ought to exclude him from being choſen Commiſſioner to, or ſitting in a Gen. Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. The Aſſembly, ſince the firſt Reformation, and that upon good grounds, having alwaies taken care that all her Members ſhould be free of ſcandal, and of a good report: and that this is a ſcandal more then ordinary in the judgment of the Commiſſion, both in Doctrin and manners, is cleer from their Papers and Warnings, wherein they do not only loaden it with many grievous imputations, but ſtir up the Civil Magiſtrate to puniſh ſuch as are guilty of it, and gives di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to Presbyteries for cenſuring them with Eccleſiaſtical Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: Beſides, it is unqueſtionable that all citations do exclude men from being Judges in the matter for which they are cited; and therefore though they might have been admitted to ſit as Judges
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:166443:11"/>
in the Aſſembly in other particulars, which yet is not granted for the reaſon above mentioned, yet it is above controverſie that they could not have ſitten in this: and therefore it ſtill follows, that as to this particular, which was indeed the main thing, if not in a ſort, all that was to be handled in the Aſſembly, it was prelimited. As to the Third, That that Letter and Act had no influence upon Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries in the choice of their Commiſſioners: it is ſpoken againſt the truth, as will appear by theſe Inſtances: 1 All thoſe Miniſters who oppoſe the Publick Reſolutions are known to be honeſt and faithful men, and moſt of them as had wont (ordinarily theſe years paſt, becauſe of their abilitie and integrity) to be choſen Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners; but few of theſe were choſen in Presbyteries this year to be Commiſſioners to the Aſſembly; and if any ſuch were choſen, it was where the whole Presbytery was unanimous againſt the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Reſolutions; or if the Presbytery were divided in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then was there, for moſt part, either two Elections, or elſe diſſents from, and Proteſtation againſt the Election of ſuch as were unſatisfied with the Publick Reſolutions; or elſe both, as in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections of <hi>Glaſgow</hi> and <hi>Sterline</hi>; of all which no Reaſon can be given, except the Letter and Act of the Commiſſion. 2 The Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery of <hi>Dunkel</hi> having choſen their Commiſſioners to the Gen. Aſſembly, and one of their number who was a member of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion having diſſented from, and proteſted againſt the Election; becauſe ſuch as were choſen were unſatisfied with the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions proceedings: the Synod of <hi>Perth</hi> meeting a little thereafter, and receiving the Letter and Act of the Commiſſion did thereupon ſuſtain the Diſſent and Proteſtation of that man of their number, and appointed the Presbytery of <hi>Dunkel</hi> to chuſe their Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners anew again. As to the Fourth, That none were denied a voice in the Aſſembly upon the accompt of their not being ſatisfied, or being cited: albeit that were true, yet it doth not make void what is ſaid for pre-limiting the Elections by the Letter and Act of the Commiſſion, becauſe the Elections were <hi>primo inſtanti,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged in Presbyteries, by barring thoſe from being choſen who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe were in a capacity and likelihood to have been choſen, by which it having come to paſs that few ſuch were choſen; Policy taught the Aſſembly not to deny ſuch of them as were choſen, a vote upon that accompt, the votes of ſo few a number not being like to prove ſo great a diſadvantage to their buſineſs as the profeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:166443:12"/>
of them a vote would have done: But in order to this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, we do further offer theſe two things for one Anſwer. 1 That the diſcuſſing and judging of the Commiſsions of theſe in the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> who were unſatisfied with the Publick Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, was laid aſide upon this conſideration, only, becauſe the Reaſon of Mr. <hi>Rob. Ramſay</hi> his Proteſtation againſt the Election, taken from their diſſatisfaction with the Publick Reſolutions, could not (as was alleadged) be diſcuſſed till theſe Reſolutions were either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned or approven, which was in effect to exclude them from vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, becauſe of their not approving the Publick Reſolutions: And this is ſo much the ſtronger, if we ſhall conſider that it was refuſed to lay aſide the Commiſsions of theſe who had carried on theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions in the Commiſsion of the Aſſembly, until their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings ſhould be tried and approven. 2 It is to be conſidered, that the Aſſembly did ſuſtain and approve the Letter and Act of the Commiſsion for citing ſuch as were unſatisfied, which was a real excluding of all theſe who were cited upon diſſatisfaction, at leaſt from being made Judges in that particular.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> That cannot be, or is not accompted a lawful free Gen. Aſſembly, in which relevant Exceptions being timouſly propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt many of the Members thereof, and offered to be verified and inſtructed, were refuſed to be taken in conſideration; but, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of the timous proponing of theſe Exceptions, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to inſtruct the ſame, theſe Members were allowed to ſit and vote before theſe Exceptions were taken in conſideration and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed: But the Meeting of <hi>St. Andrews</hi> was ſuch, becauſe it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing propounded and urged by ſundry in that Meeting, that ſuch of the Commiſsion as had hand in the Publick Reſolutions ſhould not be permitted to ſit and vote in the Aſſembly, they being under a ſcandal and guilty of the promoting a courſe of Defection which was offered to be inſtructed until ſuch time as they ſhould be tried: yet it was refuſed to take any ſuch Exception in conſideration, or to remove them till this ſhould be tried and diſcuſsed. Therefore, &amp;c. For further clearing and confirming of this Argument, it is needful to ſpeak to theſe two things. 1 To ſhew, that it was incumbent in duty to the Aſsembly to have removed from their Meeting all perſons under ſcandal (the ſame being made known unto them) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they were purged thereof. 2 To ſhew, that the perſons obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted againſt were under ſuch ſcandals as is alleadged for the firſt;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:166443:12"/>
albeit (as we conceive) no great controverſie will be made about it, yet we offer theſe things for proof of it: 1 That the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Word of God ſpeaks for it. 2 That ſome clauſes both of our National Covenant, and Solemn League and Covenant, and Eight Deſires of the Commiſsion in the year 1648. and of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Engagement in the ſame year, and all the Church Remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for purging of Armies and Judicatories, even the late Papers gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in by the ſame Commiſsioners to the Parliament at <hi>Sterlin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Act of Claſſes for excluding of ſcandalous perſons from being Members of our Judicatories. 3 There is a Rule and Order ſet down in the Third Gen Aſsembly of this Kirk in July 1562. That at the entry of every Aſsembly, the firſt work is to be anent trying and purging of the Members thereof; where men are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be charged in Gods behalf, to declare their conſciences to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ching their Doctrin, Life and execution of their Office, if therein they be ſcandalous: like as it is appointed that any to whoſe charge any thing is laid, ought to be removed out of the Aſsembly, until his cauſe be tried; and if he be convicted, he can have no Voice until the Kirk receive ſatisfaction, and in the common order of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſet down in ſubſequent Aſsemblies, ſet down by the Aſsembly in March 1568. It is appointed, that before any meddle with any buſineſs they ſhall f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ſame is to be found in the Aſsembly 1578. <hi>Auguſt</hi> 6. at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and in the Aſsembly 1580. and in the Aſsembly 1581. which two laſt Aſsemblies, as the one of them condemned the O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:166443:13"/>
and diſcuſsed; nay, this ſame Meeting at <hi>St. Andrews</hi> upon like exception and objection, that the ſcandal of the Laird of <hi>Blake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and ſome others, their acceſſion to the unlawful Engagement was not yet ſufficiently purged, by notifying their repentance to the Aſſembly, and approving the ſame where they were removed from ſitting as Members: And we would have any man in the world to bring a reaſon why ſome Members, upon Exceptions propounded, ſhould have been removed, till theſe were tried and diſcuſſed; and yet other Members admitted againſt them as relevant? nay, more relevant Exceptions were propounded before the trying and diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of them. For the Second, That the perſons objected againſt, were under ſcandal of carrying on a courſe of Defection: It is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, not only from hear-ſay and common report, the firſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the 13. of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> and 12. Verſe, is made a ground for enquiring and making ſearch, and asking diligently after theſe who ſeduce to falſe-worſhip: And the other ground of proceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the inceſtous perſon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.11. But alſo from theſe Four Particulars. 1 The offence and ſtumbling, and ſad complaint of the plurality of the godly in the Land againſt their proceedings. 2 The Teſtimony and Letters of many Presbyteries bearing their ſtumbling and diſſatisfaction with ſuch courſes. 3. The clear ſtanding Acts, Remonſtrances, and Declarations of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer General Aſſemblies, unto the which theſe proceedings were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ametrally oppoſit. 4 The Teſtimony of ſundry Brethren of the Aſſembly offering to inſtruct what was alleadged.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Objection.</hi> The Commiſsioners of former Aſſemblies have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſuch of them as was choſen by Presbytries being admitted to be Members, before the tryal, and approbation of their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It is true, That the Commiſsioners have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to ſit until their proceedings come to be tryed and judged; but it is as true that ſuch Exception and Objection being proponed, was never rejected; There was ſince the late Reformation, no cauſe to propound any ſuch thing: the Commiſsioners till this year ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving alwayes carried themſelves faithfully, but upon ſuppoſal they had done otherwiſe, it cannot in reaſon be denied, but that there was reaſon both to propound it, and take it in conſideration: In order to this particular, it is to be remembred, that upon occaſion of the great Debate in the Aſſembly 1597. concerning the carriage and proceedings of the Commiſsion of the Gen. Aſſembly who had
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:166443:13"/>
led the Church into defection in the interval betwixt Aſſemblies by taking upon them to give in Petitions to the Parliament for Vote in Parliament to the Miniſters that ſhould be provided to Prelacies and repreſenting the true Kirk of God, and being the Third Eſtate of the Realm; the next Aſſembly which ſate in the year 1601 did make an Act appointing the Commiſsioners of the preceding Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly to give an accompt of their whole proceedings in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the next, before any other cauſe or matter be handled, and their proceeedings be allowed, or diſſallowed, as the Aſſembly ſhall think expedient; which Act was renewed in the year 1648. and doth neceſsarily infer, That they are not to be admitted to ſit as Members of the Aſsembly, though there be no ſcandal nor excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on propounded therupon, till their carriage be firſt tryed and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: muchleſs they are to be admitted when there is ſcandal and exception propounded thereupon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> It was ſufficient to remove them, when the Report of their proceedings come in to be judged, or not to admit them as Judges of the things wherein they were to be tryed; and as this was done in former Aſsemblies, ſo it was alſo done in this. <hi>Anſw.</hi> That was not ſufficient, becauſe it being objected and offered to be inſtructed, that they were under a ſcandal, and that of a very high nature, they ought not to have ſitten as Members until they had firſt been purged thereof, unleſs we may ſay that any ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous man may judge in any thing, except in the matter of his own ſcandal. 2. There was a manifeſt prejudice to the judging of their own proceedings by their ſitting, becauſe they had a hand in nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating, and appointing men, who did conſider their proceedings, and make Report thereof to the Aſsembly: nay, their Moderator and Clerk, being Moderator and Clerk of the Aſſembly, did nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate all theſe men, and were ſo groſſe therein, that except one man, they nominated none to be upon the Committee, except ſuch as were of their own judgment, though ſome few dayes after they did adde ſome few others, after it was taken notice of, and regrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in private Conference with the Moderator.</p>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:166443:14"/>
contentious of malevolous perſon be brought to nothing, becauſe they might propound Exceptions againſt each of the Members, and alleadge, That they could not ſit until theſe were firſt tryed and diſcuſsed, otherwiſe it were not a lawful free General Aſſembly. <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Objection ſtrikes againſt the propounding and hearing of any Exception whatſoever, againſt any conſtituent Member of a Judicatory, as well as againſt the preſent caſe; and therefore if the makers of it admit Exceptions againſt conſtituent Members in any caſe, they are bound no leſs then we are, to frame an Anſwer thereto, which anſwer in the preſent Caſe, as in others, they would not grant. But to the thing it ſelf, we ſay, That it is not ſufficient for removing of Members of Judicatories ſimply to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound and offer Exceptions againſt them; but theſe two things are requiſite in the Exception propounded and offered. 1. That for the matter it be ſuch as <hi>prima fronte,</hi> at leaſt ſeems relevant in law. 2. That for the truth of the fact in application to the perſons againſt whom it is made there be a ſcandal, or ſome preſumptions, or ſome offering to inſtruct and make it out; now in the preſent caſe it is clear that the exceptions propounded was relevant <hi>in jure</hi>: if there be any relevant, why a man ſhould not ſit in the General Aſsembly, this certainly is one, that he hath betrayed his former Truſt, hath made defection from the covenant and cauſe, and being inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to carry on a courſe of defection throughout the Kirk and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and as to the truth of the Fact in reference to theſe againſt whom the exception was made, all theſe three did concur a flagrant ſcandal, pregnant preſumptions, and perſons in the Judicatory of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to inſtruct and verifie what was alleadged.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> No Exception could be taken in conſideration, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſsed until the Judicatories was firſt conſtituted, and a Moderator choſen, and therefore it is nothing againſt the freedom of the Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that the Aſsembly not yet being conſtitute, and a Moderator not choſen, that they did refuſe to fall upon the tryal and diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of that Exception againſt the Commiſsioners of the former Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly. <hi>Anſw.</hi> If the Aſsembly had immediatly, upon the choice of the Moderator, fallen upon the tryal and diſcuſsing of that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and removed theſe againſt whom it was made, from ſitting in the Aſsembly as Judges in any thing until that had been done, though it could not have looſed, yet it would have leſsened the difficulty and ſtrength of the Argument; but even after the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:166443:14"/>
was choſen, and the Aſſembly now formally conſtitute, theſe men were all allowed to ſit as Members, and to be Judges in every thing that come before the Aſſembly for many dayes together before the Aſſembly had judged of the exception; nay, which is more, before their proceedings were approven by the Aſſembly, they ſate as Judges to give vote and ſentence upon this very exception propounded againſt themſelves, the ſame being one of the ſpeciall reaſons contained in the Proteſtation, which was condemned before the proceedings of the Commiſſioners were reported and approven, we ſaid that it would not have looſed the difficultie, becauſe the thing which was Deſired, was not the Tryall and Diſcuſſion of the Exception inſtantly before the choice of a Moderator, but that accordingly as was done in reference to other Members excepted againſt, ſo theſe ſhould be laid aſide, and not allowed to vote untill the Aſſembly being conſtitute, take in conſideration, and diſcuſſe the the ſame, which they were ſo far from doing, that they did peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily reject it, and admit him to vote, which was in effect to reject the exception wholly, and to determine either that it was not rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, or elſe that it was falſe, both which were abſurd. 1. Becauſe to ſay that it was not relevant, was to contradict moſt clear light of reaſon, and to ſay it was falſe, was to approve the Commiſſions proceedings before tryall of them, or hearing what was to be ſaid for verifying the exception.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> They could not be debarred untill they were found ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially ſcandalous, 1. Becauſe they were many of them, men of approven integrity in all their former carriage. 2. This had been to faſten an imputation, nay a kind of cenſure upon them before they were found guilty. 3. It had been to make way for a bad preparative, to remove a number of able and faithfull men out of a Judicatory whenſoever it ſhould pleaſe any to come in againſt them with any ſuch alleadgeances. <hi>Anſ.</hi> All theſe things are clearly enough anſwered already, yet for further ſatisfaction, we ſhortly reply, that though a Judiciall tryall and ſentence may haply be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for removing one who is already a received member of a conſtitute Judicatory, yet its not in regard of the members of a Judicatory yet to be conſtituted, or in regard of members yet not admitted; for if it were ſo, then it would follow, either that no Judicatory could conſtitute it ſelf, but behaved to have ſome other Judicatory to judge of the conſtituent Members
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:166443:15"/>
of it, or elſe that it behoved to conſtitute it ſelf of ſcandalous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: notwithſtanding of timeous information given of theſe ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals and exceptions propounded againſt the perſons under the ſame, why they could not ſit till theſe ſcandals were purged. 2. It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes the common order and directorie of procedour in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of all Judicatories. 3. It contradicts the current and conſtant tenor of the practices and proceedings of the Generall Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of this Kirk, in order to their conſtitution, who have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes removed perſons againſt whom exceptions were made, till they took tryall of the ſame, though there were no Judiciall ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence at the propounding of them produced for verifying of them. As for their former integrity, we ſhall not deny to ſundry of them that teſtimony. But as it is not the firſt time in the Kirk of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that men of underſtanding have fallen to prove others ſo, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did their former carriage when they fell from their ſtedfaſtnes, perſwade others to wink or be ſilent at their defection, and for the faſtening an imputation or kind of cenſure upon them. It was much better and more ſafe and reaſonable (ſuppoſing what is alleadged) to faſten a juſt imputation upon them, then to faſten an unjuſt and remeadileſſe prejudice upon the cauſe. But would not their being vindicated after triall, have made their righteouſneſſe ſhine more brightly. And for the preparative, it is already anſwered, That it is not ſufficient to propound things by way of exception, but that they muſt be relevant for the matter, and probable for the truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſcandal or preſumptions, or perſons offering to verifie and inſtruct: All which were in the preſent caſe.</p>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:166443:16"/>
whereof was, that their proceedings ſhould not be ratified, becauſe they did involve a conjunction with the Malignant Party; which is contrary to the Word of God, the Solemn League and Covenant, the Solemn Engagement, many Acts, Warnings and Declarations of this Kirk &amp;c. Yea, not only did they before the approving of theſe proceedings by the Aſſembly, judge the Proteſtation, whereof their own proceedings were a part, but did alſo before the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their proceedings, judge the perſons who had given it in, and gave their voices amongſt others who of them ſhould be cited, in order to Cenſure; nay, the Committee wherein that buſineſs rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Proteſtation and the in-givers of it was handled, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whoſe report thereanent the Reſolutions of the Aſſembly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in did mainly hang, was for moſt part made up of thoſe who had been Members of the Commiſſion; which things, when they are impartially conſidered by indifferent men, I beleeve will be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be very unſutable and inconſiſtent with the liberty of a free Aſſembly. There be two things, as to the matter of Fact needful to be verified in this Argument: one is, That the Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was judged and condemned, and the five Members appointed to be cited before the approving of the Commiſſion-Book. Another is this, That the Members of the Commiſsion had voice in theſe things. Of the truth of both theſe we are informed by ſome, but if any doubt, we ſhall deſire him to lay no weight upon the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment until he get the certaintie; and we our ſelves do not lay any weight upon it, but as theſe things ſhall be found true.</p>

2 Becauſe theſe are ſuch encroachments as moved the General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly in the year 1638. becauſe of the like, to judge ſeveral of the former Aſſemblies of this Kirk to be null, as may be ſeen in the Acts of that Aſſembly. We beleeve, that there is none of theſe pretended Aſſemblies for the Nullity of which ſtronger Reaſons are brought then theſe are which we have brought for the Nullity of this, and will appear to thoſe who ſhall take but a little pains to compare them together.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> If ſo be this Aſſembly had proceeded right upon the matter, or according to the mind of theſe who oppoſe the Publick Reſolutions, it is not like that they would have thought that the Reaſons alleadged did prove the Nullity of it; and if ſo, why then ſhould ſuch things be made uſe of to prove the nullity of it, becauſe ſome men are not ſatisfied with the proceedings and acts thereof. <hi>A.</hi> Albeit there were no ſuch Reaſons as is alleadged, nor any thing relating to the point of form, yet conceive, and that with much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Reaſon, that any Aſſembly proceeding wrong upon the matter, is a Null Aſſembly; becauſe Kirk Judicatories have no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to deſtruction, but all their power is to Edification. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever power the Commiſsioners in a Gen. Aſſembly have, it is by Commiſsion from their Presbyteries, which Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſsion limits them to the Word of God and the Covenant, and Acts of former Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies; therefore in ſo far as they do any thing contrary to theſe, in ſo far they may be declined, as having no power nor authority for doing any ſuch thing; which furniſhes another conſiderable reaſon for declining of this Aſſembly, not before alleadged, becauſe they have in moſt of all, and the moſt material of their proceedings, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded contrary to the truſt committed unto them by Presbyteries. 2. Albeit they had proceeded right upon the matter, yet would there ſtill have been reaſon to have inſiſted upon the Objecting of theſe things, for preſerving and vindicating the liberty of Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies; and if any had, even in the caſe of their right, proceed or ſtuck cloſely to theſe things, we ſee not what cauſe there was to blame him for ſo doing, though yet we beleeve that men in the caſe of right procedor, upon the matter would have more eaſie dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted faults; in the forme we muſt ſuppoſe it to be in theſe things as in the caſe of two Miniſters, both of them for the ſame fault, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving depoſition <hi>in ſtricto jure</hi>; and the one, as a man who is known not to Edifie, but Deſtroy; the other, known to Edifie,

though guilty of theſe faults: Will not men think that they may with ſome good conſcience ſpare the one, when they depoſe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?

But it may be ſaid, That by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation the exerciſe of the Government is ſuſpended, which may conſequently prove dangerous and deſtructive; To which we reply, 1 That the exerciſe of the Government is preſerved in the inferior, Judicatories. 2 It is much better that theſe who aſsume power to themſelves and exerciſe it to deſtruction, that they ſhould want it, and not have it; Better no General Aſsembly then a preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded one, which deſtroies inſtead of edifying: as better no Miniſter then one Uſurper over the Flock, who poyſons inſtead of feeding.</p>

As to that in the year 1582. it is groſly miſtaken, becauſe it is no waies anent declining of unlawful Aſsemblies, but againſt appealing from lawful Aſsem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies to the Civil Magiſtrate in Eccleſiaſtick cauſes, for ſtopping Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick Diſcipline againſt the perſons appealers, as is further evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the occaſion thereof: Mr. <hi>Robert Montgomery</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> his producing Letters of Horning from the King &amp; Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, charging the Aſsembly to deſiſt from his Proceſs, and ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their Sentence in the mean time, till the King and Counſel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſame; againſt which the Kirk entred a Proteſtation. From theſe things it may appear how unwarantably the Meeting at <hi>Dundee</hi> did upon alleadgance of this Act fall upon debate of the ſummar Excommunication of theſe who had proteſted.</p>

firſt, That the other Paper was lately contrived, that is, a litle while before the writing of this Vindication: But if the Vindication was not written many moneths before it came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, the Author thereof is miſtaken in this, becauſe this Paper was contrived within a very few weeks, three or four at moſt, after the Proteſtation it ſelf, it may be that it came but lately to his hand, but it was abroad long before his Vindication was heard of. 2. It is aſſerted, that this Paper was contrived by ſome, practizing to foment diviſions, and to fix a Schiſme in this Kirk. But their hearts bear them record, that the fomenting or fixing of diviſion or ſchiſme juſtly ſo called, as it never was, nor is their purpoſe, ſo hath it been far from their practice, either in that or any other particular This indeed they do acknowledge, that they are unwilling to ſuffer themſelves to be divided from the truth formerly received and profeſſed by the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi>; and that they conceive themſelves bound in their ſtations and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, to bear teſtimony againſt the courſe of back-ſliding, carried on in the Land, of which they judge the common Conſtitution and Acts of that Aſſembly to be no ſmall part; and though to foment diviſions and fix a Schiſme in the Church, be a heavy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, yet being conſcious to themſelves of their own inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, they are not much moved with it, remembring that it is the common Topick whence decliners in all the Ages of the Church have argued againſt theſe who would not be conſenting unto, or did teſtifie againſt their defection; Peace and unity hath been their plea, and ſedition, diviſion and ſchiſme their charge againſt their oppoſers; upon this accompt doth the Lord Jeſus and his Apoſtles, by the Scribes and Phariſees and Elders of the Jewes, <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> and our firſt Reformers by the Pope and his Clergy; Nonformiſts by the Prelats and their adherents, ſtand recorded in the Catalogue of theſe who practized to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment diviſions, and fix a ſchiſme in the Church. 3. It is aſſerted, That this Paper <hi>was ſpread abroad onely into the hands of ſuch as they conceive will be inclineable to follow their way, but kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up from all others.</hi> If they had directly ſent Copies to theſe of a contrary judgment, it might haply been thought a piece of vanity and preſumption; and if the Author of this Vindication thought ſuch a thing incumbent to them, why did he not ſend a

Copy of his Anſwer to the contrivers of theſe Papers, whom (as he afterwards bears us in hand) he doth very wel know, or hath he ſpoken with, or received evidence from all others, who were not inclinable to follow that way that he doth ſo confidently aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert that Paper to have been kept up from all of them; I will aſſure him, it was not ſo as he affirmes; As the contrivers did not vainly nor boaſtingly ſpread it to the provoking of any, ſo did they not purpoſely keep it up from any of whatſoever judgment, but were willing and deſirous that it ſhould go abroad, for edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of as many as the Lord ſhould be pleaſed to bleſſe it unto; And therefore did they not onely give Copies to ſuch as did deſire them, but alſo did uſe ſome means to have gotten it Printed, and could get none to undertake it.</p>

                        <p>I ſhall not contend with the Author about the truth of that General Aſſertion: That things extrinſecal to a Cauſe may have
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:166443:22"/>
influence upon mens judgements, to byaſſe them againſt the weight of reaſon; It doth indeed oft-times fall out ſo to be, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in things that relate to Religion, neither ſhall I make any application to himſelf, or to the owners and fallowers of the Cauſe which he defends. I wiſh that all of us, on all hands may from the reall ſenſe of the great blindneſſe that is in our underſtandings, and many byaſſes that are in our hearts, with much trembling and fear, make humble, ſerious and frequent addreſſes unto God, that he would give us rightly to know, and in ſingleneſſe of heart to judge of the truth in theſe things, without laying weight on any thing that will not bear weight in the ballance of the Sanctuary. But haply indifferent men would have accounted it fairer dealing, if not more prudence if he had left the Cauſe ſimply to be determined by the weight of his Anſwers and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and had not ſo operouſly and induſtriouſly laboured to bring the Reader in diſlike with the Proteſters, by charging ſome of them with high crimes, and endeavouring to weaken the Reputation of all of them, by a long deduction, and many farre fetched Inſtances of things on the by; If his Anſwers be ſtrong enough for a batterie, what needed theſe undermindings? But its fit to take ſome View of theſe miſleading Principles, wherewith he chargeth the Proteſters, and their adherents, and of which he deſires others to beware leaſt they be thereby alſo inſnared; onely this advertiſement I give, that his charge in all theſe things runneth onely upon the Principles and Practiſes of ſome of the Proteſters; Now upon ſuppoſall that all his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeance were true, what a poor way of arguing would theſe that are for the Publick Reſolutions, and for the Aſſembly at St. <hi>Andrews</hi> and <hi>Dundee</hi> account it, to tell them over ſome few of the many groſſe Principles, and Practices holden and acted by ſome of their party, and from thence to conclude againſt their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, and to the prejudice of their Cauſe.</p>

of many of them that they followed that courſe in the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of their hearts; yet I leave it to all judicious indifferent men to conſider &amp; give their judgment, if it be not very apparent that ſomewhat of this kind was the ſpring that moved ſome, the prime contrivers and ſticklers in this buſineſſe, who having ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured upon ſuch high courſes and attempts, tending to the violation of the Nationall Faith, renting and ruining the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, trampling upon Authority, and carrying with them te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, contrary to the minde and Practice of all Orthodox Kirks, and to the Faith, and not being able to abide triall in theſe things by an Aſſembly, who in themſelves was not able to bear the ſway, and carry things to their minde, and finding others in ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of heart with them diſliking ſome Publick Reſolutions and Actings, and ſo apt to be led on with them upon any courſe that could be preſented with the colour of a Teſtimony againſt theſe Reſolutions and Actings, found it ſafeſt; for they rather alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether do diſclaim the authority of the Aſſembly, then to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard upon a fair and orderly tryall of their matters; yea, have we not ſeen ſome already ſhip in, and land out of, and ſhip in again in that Proteſtation, according as they conceived the winde of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs then in the time to blow with, or againſt it, to credit, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit, advantage or diſadvantage; conſcientious men would beware now that this ſame motive or intereſt, do not prevail over them, to neglect due Examination of the grounds of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, or to cloſe their eye againſt ſuch light as might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be holden forth in this matter, to the diſcovery of the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and non-relevancy of theſe grounds and reaſons; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore put reputation and diſ-reputation in the eſtimation of men, advantage, or diſ-advantage worldly to thee and thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, put off thy ſight for a while, untill thou haſt pondered and compared reaſon with reaſon.</p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:166443:23"/>
to the violation of the Nationall Oath, renting and ruining the Kingdom, trampling on Authority, and carrying with them te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets contrary to the minde and practice of all Orthodox Churches and to the Faith, &amp;c What is all this, but the way, if not very near the words of the Prelaticall and Malignant party, againſt the Inſtruments of the Work of Reformation <hi>Anno</hi> 1638 and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, who becauſe the Integrity of ſome of theſe Inſtruments was above exception, they did caſt the appearing of theſe in that Work upon their ſimplicity, and did charge others with falling on a courſe of rebellion, as not being able to endure triall in the high crimes, whereof (as they ſaid) they were guilty; but the Lord ere long did make their righteouſnes break forth as the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and their clearing as the noon day, and I truſt that he who knowes the Innocency of theſe Proteſters upon whom the like things are charged, ſhall alſo ſhew them the like mercy in Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating them from all the reproach that hath been unjuſtly caſt upon them. But to the point if theſe prime Contrivers, and ſticklers in the buſineſſe, had before that time adventured on ſuch high courſes, and were guilty of ſuch grievous crimes as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor chargeth them with, then ſurely theſe ſimple ones of whom he ſpeaks, were ſimple exceedingly, who could ſee nor diſcern none of theſe things that were ſo obvious to the view of others; but notwithſtanding of what he ſayes, they are known to ſharp ſighted decerning men, and for learning, circumſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, judgement prudence and experience in the things of God, and the Affairs of his houſe to be far beyond theſe whom he takes for the prime contrivers and ſticklers in the buſineſſe, and to be inferior to none of their oppoſers; yea, if there be any who deſerve the name of the prime contrivers and ſticklers in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Proteſtation it is ſome of theſe who had no hand in theſe high courſes which he mentions, and who upon his accompt are among the ſimple ones. Theſe crimes which he doth ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively, and without heſitation charge upon ſome, eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo hainous and great: It would ſeem, that both charity and and juſtice would have required that he had brought ſome good evidence of them, leaſt haply his Reader truſt not his naked Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, in that which doth not onely reach the reputation, but alſo the life and being of others; And if he would have men to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:166443:23"/>
believe their tenets to be contrary to the minde and practice of all Orthodox Churches, and to the Faith; he would do well to prove them to be ſo, untill he do it, he will I hope allow chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to theſe who deny it: Some of the greateſt Divines of this Church, and of this age whoſe praiſe is in all the Reformed Churches do affirm and have proved the contrary, and if the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Aſſertion be true, I fear not to ſay, that the minde and practice of this Church theſe years paſt hath not been Orthodox nor agreeable to the faith in order to theſe tenets, becauſe they have been clearly taught and practiſed by this Church theſe years paſt, and a man but ſlenderly ſeen in the Doctrine thereof may bring forth theſe tenets aſſerted by this Church in the ſame let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and ſillabes; and may give clear inſtances of her practices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing with the ſame; It hath been done already by ſome in a more convincing way then the ſharpeſt oppoſers of theſe tenets have as yet ſatisfyingly anſwered. I would fain know what ground the Author had to ſay, that the prime contrivers and ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers found it ſafeſt for them rather altogether to diſclaim the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Aſſembly, then to hazard upon a fair and orderly trial of their matters. Their conſciences do bear them record, that it was not upon any jealouſie or ſuſpition they had of their Cauſe as not being able to endure the light; &amp; reaſon may perſwade indif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ferent men to think, that they did not look upon proteſting againſt the Aſſembly as the ſafeſt courſe otherwiſe then in order to their duty, for if we take ſafety as it might concern their perſons, they could hardly have done any thing that could have more endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered theſe: It was a ſpeedy way to expoſe them to the cenſures both of Church and State, as did appear in the ſequel, ſome of them becauſe of their Proteſting being depoſed by that Aſſembly, and others of them confined by the civil Magiſtrate, and there is ground to preſume that they would have been proceeded againſt with further cenſures, both civil and Eccleſiaſtick, if the Lord had not ſtopt the current of theſe things; If this was their ſafeſt way, why do men of his own judgment ſo frequently ſay, that if the Proteſtation had been forborn, the Aſſembly would not have cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red any, no not in the caſe of their adhering to their judgment, and diſſenting from the judgment of the Aſſembly in the matters of the Publick Reſolutions. If we ſhal take ſafety in order to the cauſe,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:166443:24"/>
they could not be ſo dull as to think, that their Proteſting againſt the Aſſembly would keep the Aſſembly from trying and judging of their cauſe, or other indifferent men from ſearching into the ſame, and if before the Proteſtation, it could not abide the triall, it did but put them in a much worſe condition to Proteſt upon an unwarrantable ground, it being worſe to defend two evill cauſes then one: And therefore it doth not appear from theſe things that ſelf-intereſt was the ſpring from whence theſe Actings did flow; yea, the contrary (if any thing) is manifeſt, becauſe by ſuch a way they could expect nothing but the hightning of all former reproaches caſt on them, the expoſing of themſelvs to the cenſures both of Church and State, if men that in all their precious inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts muſt be ſufferers becauſe of their doing of ſuch things, be led to act therein upon a principle of ſelfiſh intereſt, we leave it to judicious and indifferent men to conſider and give their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether it be very apparent, yea, or not? It is true that ſome two or three did partly by the perſwaſion, and partly by the threatning of ſome at <hi>Dundee,</hi> reſile a little from the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony which they had given at <hi>St Andrews</hi> in the matter of the Proteſtation, which within a ſhort time thereafter they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of, and again adhered to their former Teſtimony, not upon any ſelfiſh-intereſt, or eye to credite or advantage (as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor affirmes) there being no appearance firſt or laſt, that by adhering to the Proteſtation they could gain any of theſe things, but on the checks of their own conſciences, and <hi>the voice they heard behind them, ſaying, this is the way walk ye in it,</hi> when they had turned aſide, ſome of them are ſince that time taken out of the land of the living, and I truſt are now in glory, and I can aſſure the Author and all others, and if it be doubted, I wil get it atteſted under the hands of famous witneſſes; that after their reſiling from that teſtimony they had no peace nor quietnes in their ſpirits for a long time, but went down mourning to their graves, becauſe they had ſo done, and upon their death beds did often and ſadly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moan it, that they had miſſed the opportunity to give ſome publick Teſtimony and Declaration with others of their ſorrow for the ſame, and of their purpoſe and reſolution to adhere to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation. It had been no loſſe to the Author nor his cauſe, to have ſpared ſuch ſharp (let me not ſay bitter) and perſonal

reflections upon conſcientious and godly men, as he many times needleſly uſeth, he and all others whoſe eyes God hath opened, to ſee their way, cannot but be conſcious to themſelves of their own wandrings, and how much they owe to the exceeding riches of the mercy and free grace of God, that hath recovered them out of ſnares.</p>

                        <p>I do indeed believe, that the Author doth not intend to ſay or adviſe any thing to the prejudice or diſadvantage of godlines, or godly men; yet do I deſire him ſeriouſly, and in ſoberneſſe of minde, as before the Lord, to conſider, whether there hath been ſomething in the late Publick Reſolutions, and in the proceedings and Acts of the late Aſſembly at <hi>Dundee,</hi> to both which (if I miſtake not) he had a great acceſſion, that is prejudiciall to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and to godly men: Reſpect to theſe did exceedingly abate with the Publick Reſolutions; yea, enimity againſt theſe did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly grow with theſe reſolutions; a thing ſo manifeſt, that they who did run, could not but read it; and did not the Acts at <hi>Dundee,</hi> wherein beſides the cenſures that were inflicted on ſome, all, whether Miniſters, Elders, Expectants, Schoolmaſters, Students or Profeſſors of whatſoever ſort, who ſhall not acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce to the Acts and Concluſions of that Aſſembly, and who after conference for their ſatisfaction, oppoſe the ſame, are appointed to be cenſured, do not (I ſay) theſe Acts import a prejudice to godlineſs and godly men, if proſecuted and executed, they would at laſt non-Office, and non-Church many Godly Church-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers

and godly Church-Members; yea, I fear the greateſt part of the Godly in the Land. His teſtimony concerning the godlineſs of many of the Authors and Abettors of this Proteſtation, I do willingly accept, as ſavouring of ingenuity, and having truth in it: I wiſh he had been as plain and poſitive in giving his judgment concerning others: Whileſt he differences them from theſe to whoſe godlineſs he bears teſtimony, and ſaith, that what ever they have been every whit, he will not take upon him to judge; it ſeems that he would render them ſuſpected, if not have them taken for perſons naughty or little worth, what ever be his meaning in it, or his judgment of theſe others, I ſhal not ſtand to enquire into it; there be none of the Authors or Abettors of that Proteſtation, to whom many of the godly in <hi>Scotland</hi> will not give an honeſt teſtimony, neither will any thing that any of them have been, contradict the ſame, if at any time they have been in a wrong way, yet have they through grace repented of, and forſaken the ſame: And it concerns the Author, who hath been a ſharer of the like precious mercy, not to upbraid them, but to acknowledge the goodneſs of the Lord both to them and to himſelf. I deny not, that there are godly men on the other ſide, and ſuch as ſuffered for the Truth and Cauſe of God; but why he ſhould ſay, that ſome of them were in Chriſt before the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſters, and that they were ſufferers for the truth, when others had not the honour to be deors for it, I do not well underſtand; ſundry of the Proteſters, for their being in Chriſt, and ſuffering for the Truth and Cauſe of God, are through grace, of a very old and longſtanding, and famous &amp; honorable in all this Church. I cannot reckon the moneths or years ſince the one or the other did begin to be in Chriſt, and had the honour to ſuffer for the truth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I deſire to inſiſt on the compariſon, bleſſed be the Lord for all that are in Chriſt, and for all who ſuffers for his Cauſe, I wiſh and pray, that all of them may conquer and overcome, and if any of them be turned out of the way, the Lord may again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them, and make their laſt dayes better then their firſt. It is true, ſome of the Proteſters had not the honour to be doers for the Cauſe; yea, were oppoſers of it, when ſome of the other ſide were ſuffering for it; but what if they have obtained mercy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did it ignorantly through unbelief: if not to be a doer
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:166443:26"/>
for the Cauſe; yea, if to be bearers down and oppoſers of the Cauſe, when others were ſuffering for it, be a good plea againſt any of the Proteſters, I fear moſt part of the late Aſſembly muſt leave their Benches and go to the Bar. I know none that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces theſe godly men as Apoſtates; yea, I know and am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that the Proteſters have an high and honourable eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them for their piety and parts, and for the great things whereof the Lord hath made ſundry of them inſtrumentall in his Houſe; and though they cannot but teſtifie, unleſſe they would be unfaithfull, that the courſe which theſe men have followed this while paſt in the matter of the Publick Reſolutions, is a courſe of defection and back-ſliding, yet do they not uſe to call them back-ſliders, much leſſe Apoſtates, and if any others do it, they are not therein approven or allowed by them. I joyn with the Author in his advice, that men ſhould take heed that they make not a ſnare of the opinion; yea, or the reall conviction of the godlineſſe they have of any perſons by approving, taking up, or following their ſayings, opinions or practices, without due ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination and tryall upon this accompt becauſe they are godly perſons, from whom ſuch things proceeds, as being an advice wholeſome and profitable in it ſelf, and as having ground to think, that the eſtimation of ſome mens perſons and judgements the laſt year, had influence upon ſome, to gain them to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Reſolutions, and to the proceedings of the Aſſembly. I do alſo joyn with him in the ſubſtance of the two things which he adds for ſtrengthning of this preſent caution, only deſiring him to be impartial in the application of the firſt, and to look homeward aſwell as abroad, and to guard well both in the firſt and laſt, that in diſcovering the errors or weakneſs of ſome who are truly god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or the hypocriſie of others who pretend it, the hands of the prophane, and ſuch as hate and mock at godlineſs, and inſult o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the infirmities and blemiſhes of the Saints be not ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, nor godlineſs nor godly men brought in contempt.</p>

the deſign of the Remonſtrance: the former part of this is evident from the Weſtern Remonſtrance, condemning the Treaty with the King, and cloſing thereof, allowed, approven and ratified by the Generall Aſſembly <hi>1650.</hi> If it be ſaid, that that Remonſtrance was communicated to the Commiſſion of the Kirk before it was preſented to the Eſtate, that is true; But beſide that, the Commiſsion had not power to judge the Acts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtisutions of the Aſſembly. It was preſented unto them meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have had their concurrence in preſenting it to the Eſtate, if that could have been obtained; but with no deſire to adviſe and give their judgment upon the matter contained in it; yea, theſe that came with it, required, If they had any power com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them to change any thing of it; they plainly declared, that though ſome expreſſions might be changed, yet they had no power, and were not to alter one jote of the matter; ſo determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned were they of themſelves, and antecedently to the cognition of the Publick Judicatories.

I acknowledge, that I have no great skill of School tearms; but I conceive, that when in this place he ſpeaks of the Ordinances <hi>in concreto,</hi> and as they are <hi>in actu exercito,</hi> actually exiſting, and as they are exerciſed in Judicatories conſtitute accordingly, he means not of every kinde of concretion and exerciſe of Ordinance <hi>quovis modo</hi>; for they may have an honeſt and honourable eſtimation of Ordinances, who bear teſtimony againſt the corruptions and mal-adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the abuſers of them; otherwayes theſe who have been moſt zealous and ſtraight-hearted for the Ordinances in all Ages, ſhould be found among the deſpiſers of Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and none more then many of the gracious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies of this Land, who were ready to lay down their lives for the Ordinances, and yet did bear publick te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony both againſt the corrupt conſtitution and corrupt Acts of Aſſemblies, and all male-adminiſtrations that were of any importance to the prejudice of the Kirk, or any of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Chriſt therein, which was ſo far from rendering their profeſſions ſuſpected, that it was a reall evidence of the truth and ſincerity thereof. But I think he means of ſuch a concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and exerciſe of Ordinances, (though it had been fit to expreſſe it more clearly) as is agreeable to the rule of Gods Word, for ſo he ſeems to hint, when he ſayeth, <hi>as they are Judicatories conſtitute accordingly</hi>; and in this ſenſe the carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:166443:28"/>
of the Proteſters doth well ſtand with their Profeſſiors, in reference to the Ordinances. Having laid down this ground and diſtinction of Ordinances, not onely in the abſtract and dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, but alſo <hi>in concreto,</hi> and as they are <hi>in actu exercito</hi>; he comes in the next place to give ſome inſtances of ſome practices of ſome of the Proteſters, in ſetting down of which he hath been very induſtrious, to gather and put together a bundle of ſuch things as he thinks may bring their Profeſſions in ſuſpicion and contempt; I ſhall not meet him with the like meaſure; if it were Chriſtian and ſeaſonable work, more haply might be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den forth of the practices, not of ſome only, but of many ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers for the Publick Reſolutions, that goes croſs their Profeſſion to the Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline and Government of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> then the Author can or will anſwer; but becauſe to recriminate, is not to anſwer, I come to the particular inſtances which he gives: The firſt is, their condemning Acts and Conſtitutions of the ſupream Judicatories of this Church. which he aggravates by many circumſtances. Firſt, that theſe Acts were moſt unanimouſly concluded. Secondly, that themſelvs were preſent, and did not contradict. Thirdly, that they were poſitively conſenting thereto by their Votes. Fourthly, that they condemned theſe Acts, not in a private way, but in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance, publickly emitted to the World, and preſented to the State. Fifthly, that all this was done, without having ſo much reſpect to theſe Judicatories, as firſt to have recourſe to them by ſupplication, and deſire to re-examine, or take to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration again theſe Acts and Conſtitutions. yea, refuſing to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves to them in ſuch a way, when adviſed and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſſed thereto, as orderly, by ſome to whom they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the deſign of the Remonſtrance. To all which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, that the Argument taken in its ſtrength, doth not ſeem to conclude much for evacuating the Profeſſions of the Proteſters to the Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline and Government of this Church, unleſſe we lay this for a ground, that whoſoever repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents and remonſtrates his judgment againſt any one of the Acts of the Aſſembly of this Church, belyes the Profeſſion which he makes of reſpect to the Doctrine, Worſhip, Government and Diſcipline thereof.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:166443:29"/>
Secondly, the Aſſembly was not ſufficiently informed concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning theſe tranſactions with the King, but ſeverall important particulars which would have contributed much for clearing of the buſineſſe, were keeped up from, and not reported to the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; to wit, the firſt invitation given to the King, the Act appointing him to be reſtored to the exerciſe of his power, the Kings Letters to <hi>James Graham,</hi> the Kings taking the Sacrament after the order of the Service Book kneeling, from an Epiſcopall Doctor, and an Iriſh Biſhop, notwithſtanding that he had ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Treaty, and that interceſſions were made to him both by word and write, to forbear the bringing to ſea with the King all the Engliſh and Scots Malignants that were with him at <hi>Breda</hi> after the Commiſſioners had received the Letters and Acts both of Church and State, diſapproving the Treaty at <hi>Breda</hi>: The way how the King was induced to ſubſcribe the Covenant, and how immediatly before his taking it, being ready to land in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he was about to have made a Proteſtation, but that ſome of the Commiſſioners would not tender him the Covenant upon theſe terms. How lame the accompt was that was given to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Aſſembly of that buſineſſe; ſome of the Commiſſioners con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion before the Commiſſion of the Church at <hi>Striveling</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Dunbar</hi> doth bear witneſſe; it may be remembered that the Moderator then regrated, that the plain buſineſſe was not made known to the Generall Aſſembly, and that moſt of what was ſpoken in that debate at <hi>Striveling</hi> tended rather to clear the Gen. Aſſembly then to juſtifie the Treaty; and indeed theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſcoverie; of hidden and ſinfully concealed truths, may plead for a fair conſtruction of what the Aſſembly did in approving their Commiſſioners proceedings, which belike they would not have approven if they had known all the truth: And do afford ſufficient ground for the Remonſtrators afterward to Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate them, without reflecting upon the Aſſembly or upon their own profeſſions of reſpect to the Doctrine and Government of this Church. Secondly, theſe acts were not ſo moſt unanimouſly concluded as the Author affirmes: It is true, that there was no Proteſtation nor open and plain diſſent by any member of the Aſſembly againſt them, but ſeverall members who had profeſt their diſ-ſatisfaction with that matter in private, when it came to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:166443:29"/>
be voted in Publick, they did ſo qualifie their Vote, that it did relate onely to the approving of the diligence of the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, inſinuating that they were not clear to approve of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; I acknowledge that it was a weakneſſe that they did not plainly declare their minde (which ſome of them were requeſted to forbear) but this ſhews that there was not ſo great unanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in that matter as he ſpeaks of: He is not ignorant that as that buſineſſe was from the firſt to the laſt raſhly tranſacted, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the inclinations of the generality of the Godly in the land, whilſt they yet did ſee the King continuing in his oppoſition to the work of God, ſo alſo againſt the inclination of many in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, who yet could not find a ground to diſſent oppenly from that concluſion, becauſe of the fair repreſentation of the matter made to them. Thirdly, before the Remonſtrance was penned, there was palpable and clear diſcoveries of the hollownes of that tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action in <hi>Holland</hi>; the King had given Commiſſions to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants to riſe in Armes, and had himſelf deſerted the Judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and gone away to join with the Malignants, and ſeverall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things of that kinde were made known, before there was any meeting about the Remonſtrance, let be any concluſion taken upon it. Fourthly, there could not be any addreſs to theſe Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories by way of ſupplication, or otherwiſe to deſire them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examine, or to take to their conſideration again theſe Acts and Conſtitutions, becauſe the Gen. Aſſ. which (only by the Authors own acknowledgement) had power ſo to do, was not then ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, nor to ſit for eight or nine moneths thereafter; and the Lord having ſmitten us ſo ſore, as at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> and being ſtill threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning more wrath, it was no time to delay, nor dallie the repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the grounds of his controverſie. Fifthly, when that Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance paſt, the Forces of the Weſt, were encloſed between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces at <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> and thoſe at <hi>Carlile,</hi> and reſolved to lay down their lives in the defence of their Religion and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and therefore thought themſelves bound to exoner their conſciences in a free and plain way, and to leave that Teſtimony behinde them concerning the guiltineſſe of the Land, and the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories thereof. Sixthly, that Remonſtrance was not the deed of ſome of the Proteſters onely, but for the ſubſtance: Firſt, the deed of one of the beſt, and moſt famous Synods of this Church,

and afterwards both for ſubſtance and words, the deed of a very conſiderable number of Officers, gentlemen and Miniſters, whoſe integrity and zeal for the Publicke Cauſe from the beginning was known and approven, not onely to the Judicatories of Church and State, but to all good men throughout the Land. Seventhly, that as it is true, that theſe who came with the Remonſtrance to preſent it to the Committee of Eſtates, being required if they had any power committed to them to change any thing thereof, did plainly declare, that though ſome expreſſions might be changed, yet they had no power to alter any thing in the matter; So it is no leſſe true, that theſe who did require them, if they had any ſuch power, being told, that they had power to communicate the ſame unto them, before they gave it in to the Committee, and to take their advice and aſſiſtance therein, did not after the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hearing thereof, profeſſe any diſlike of the matter therein contained, much leſſe did they uſe any arguments to diſwade them from giving it in, which gave juſt ground to the other to think that they did approve thereof, they being men of ſuch ripneſſe of judgement, freedome, intimacy and friendlineſſe with theſe who gave it in, that they could not but look upon their ſilence as an approving of their way. Eigthly, let it be conſidered, whether the Remonſtrators, or theſe who were hugged by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Church, and the Meeting at <hi>St. Andrews</hi> and <hi>Dundee,</hi> was their beſt friends, and moſt forward for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Reſolutions, are this day moſt tender of the Liberties of Church and State; the latter conſenting to all the demands of the preſent power, and the former every where refuſing, as to that which is ſaid to be proved by Mr. <hi>John Carſtares</hi> his Letter to the Lord Regiſter, how weakly is this alledged; Mr. <hi>John Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtares</hi> was then a priſoner at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the Remonſtrators were at <hi>Dumfreis</hi>: the Remonſtrance was preſented at <hi>Strive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>; he knew not ſo much as either matter or forme of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance till it was preſented, how then could he give advice therein? Or if his Letter was intercepted, how could that advice come to their hands that they might hearken thereto? If there had been any thing in that Letter that made for his purpoſe, why did not the Author cite the words of it after the intercepting thereof? It was ſhewed to Mr. <hi>Robert Dowglas,</hi> and diverſe

others, and as it did then, ſo if it were needfull to make it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, it would now prove, that there was nothing in it of which either Mr. <hi>John,</hi> or my Lord Regiſter needs to be aſhamed; and it would abundantly confute the calumnies of ſome, and correct the miſtakes of others, particularly in the thing for which it is alledged.</p>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:166443:35"/>
at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> before the Kings home comming, had in a very large Letter to the Commiſſioners at <hi>Holland,</hi> holden forth their great diſ-ſatisfaction with the Proceedings of that Treaty in many particulars; and the Commiſsion at <hi>Leith,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the defeat at <hi>Dumbar,</hi> had alſo holden forth the Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant deſign that was then carryed on, and had given it in as a publick cauſe of humiliation to the Committee of Eſtates. It is true that the Commiſſion was <hi>de facto</hi> conveened within eight dayes, but as we have already ſaid: It was not propable at the time or emitting theſe cauſe, that it ſhould ſo have been; and I pray the Author or any rationall men ſoberly, to think what motive but the ſenſe of duety, and the preſſing expediencie of the thing ſhould have induced theſe Proteſters of whom he ſpeaks to be ſo headſtrong and forward, to anticipate the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Commiſſion, ſeing they had ground to think, that the Commiſſion at their Meeting were like to condeſcend on theſe things as cauſes of Gods wrath, which was verified thereafter, by the approving thereof; but the Author tels us that the Commiſſion did both alter ſomewhat (of which I ſhall afterwards ſpeak, and adde ſome thing; to wit, a Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, recommending prayer for the King; aſwell as mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his ſins, which by the debate that was made againſt it by Mr. <hi>James Guthrie</hi> and the Regiſter, for the ſpace of half an hour (as he ſayeth) ſeemed to have been purpoſely left out, and that which the Commiſſion approved was the matter of theſe cauſes, and not the way of emiſsion, wherewith many of the Commiſsion ſhewed themſelves diſ-ſatisfied as a practice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out example, and a preparative tending to the overthrow of the Government. The Commiſsion did indeed adde that poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript concerning prayer for the King, againſt the expediency of which addition to be made at that time, Mr. <hi>James Guthrie</hi> and the Regiſter did for a little debate, how the Author ſhould know ſo exactly the meaſure of the time, I leave it for himſelf to anſwer, the ground of their ſo doing was not that which he alledgeth; the Regiſter hath many living witneſſes that he was no adverſary to praying for the King; and Mr. <hi>James Guthrie</hi> having keeped that humiliation publickly in the Congregation at <hi>Striveling,</hi> before the Commiſsion did meet or make any

                        <p>I Shall not deny, but ſome of theſe Brethren have in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall way, reaſon to be humbled for the diviſions of the Land, as they are the righteous judgments of the Lord upon their ſins, which have been greater then the ſins of many; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther am I ſo zealous of their credit, as to ſay, that no circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of their carriage in theſe things, could have been better ordered, they are but poor weak men, compaſſed with many infirmities, and ſubject to the like paſſions with others; but that they have reaſon to be humbled in a ſpeciall way, upon the accompt of being the Authors, let be the main Authors and promovers of theſe rents and diviſions, is a groundleſſe and unjuſt charge, which no man is able to make out; the Author doth either unknowingly or willingly miſtake in that which he calls the <hi>firſt ſtep of the diviſions,</hi> to wit, the dividing of one part of the remnant of the Army from the Army, by theſe Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: Theſe Gentlemen who did remove from <hi>Sterlin</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after <hi>Dunbar,</hi> unto the Weſt, did go thither by the order and approbation of the Committee of Eſtates, who did alſo appoint the Leavies of the Weſt, and their Conducters, and deſigned their work to them from time to time, as can be made good by many Acts and Letters, under the Lord Chancellour and Clerk of the Committees hand, and they were therein alſo countenanced by the Commiſſion of the Church, who wrote to them for their encouragement; yea, it was the counſell of ſome of theſe who were chief in the Aſſembly at <hi>Dundee,</hi> that theſe Gentlemen went Weſt. That they did not joyn with the reſt of the Forces of the Kingdom, was, becauſe it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to ſtate the War as it was formerly ſtated by the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church and State on the 13. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1650. and to ſatisfie them in the conduct of the Army, by appointing a man qualified according to the ſolemn Engagement, to lead the Forces. What he ſayeth of the Remonſtrance, which he calls the next ſtep of our diviſion, is anſwered already, except that which he alleadges, that it doth in the cloſe thereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a bond, engaging themſelves to proſecute the matters of that Remonſtrance, according to their power, which hath been
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:166443:40"/>
often cleared by themſelves, that it did contain no new bond to any new thing, but a declaration of their reſolutions to keep their former bonds and engagements; in teſtimony whereof, they were willing, and did often offer to explain their meaning in this particular, for the ſatisfaction of theſe who doubted thereof. He doth (under favour) make a very lame relation of the Conference at <hi>Pearth.</hi> In that conference theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Miniſters who were ſent from the Weſt, did often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that they were willing to fight upon that ſtate of the quarrell holden forth in the Declaration of the 13. <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and to joyn under the leading Officer of the Forces of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, providing that he were a man qualified according to the ſolemn Engagement to duties, to wit, of a blameleſſe and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian converſation, and of unqueſtionable integrity and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Cauſe of God; In neither of which, ſatisfaction was offered unto them, and therefore it is no wonder though they had refuſed to hearken to the Propoſition which the Author ſpeaks of. What he ſayeth of their with-drawing themſelves from the Commiſſion, upon occaſion of condemning the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance, and of their not daigning to come again, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready anſwered ſomewhat unto it, and ſhall anſwer more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. For clearing of that which concerns the Letters written to the Commiſſion, and teſtimonies given againſt the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions Anſwer to the Parliaments Quare, I ſhall firſt ſet down ſome thing of the matter of fact, then anſwer ſhortly to what the Author ſayeth. After that the Party of Malignant and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected men in the Land, who by ſubtility and fair pretences had got the power of the Judicatories and of the Army in their hand, <hi>Anno</hi> 1648. were defeat at <hi>Preſton,</hi> the Kingdome and Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> taking in conſideration how often they had been deceived by that Party, and how much they had ſinned againſt God, and ſmarted under his hand by intruſting of them, and complying with them, did in a ſolemn publick way confeſs this ſin, and did ſolemnly before the Lord, engage themſelves to do no more ſo, but to be carefull to purge out all ſcandalous and malignant men out of the Judicatories and Army, and to endeavour that ſuch as was intruſted therein, ſhould be of a blameleſſe and Chriſtian converſation, and of conſtant integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:166443:41"/>
and affection to the Cauſe of God. In order to this ſolemn Confeſsion and engagement, did many Supplications, Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Remonſtrances and Declarations iſſue from the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Church, and ſeverall Lawes and Acts from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and Commitree of Eſtates, for purging and keeping pure the Judicatories &amp; the Army, according to which, many endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours were uſed for putting the ſame in execution, which for ſome time went on with ſome meaſure of ſucceſſe and bleſsing; but that ſo good and neceſſary a work, did very ſoon begin to be retarded and oppoſed; firſt cloſely, and in an undermining way by ſome who did again begin to owne Malignant Intereſts; and afterwards more openly and avowedly; yet was the ſinfulneſſe of complying with, and employing that Party ſo much abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and feared by the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that not onely did the Commiſsion of the Generall Aſſembly of the year 1649. and the Generall Aſſembly it ſelf 1650. in the very time when the Land was invaded by the Engliſh, declare the employing and intruſting of ſuch to be unlawfull, even in the caſe of ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of men for the Lands defence, but alſo the Commiſsion of the Generall Aſſembly of the year 1650. did after the defeat at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> once and again give publick warning to all the Land to beware of complyances with that Party, and to take heed that under a pretence of doing for the Cauſe, and for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, they get not power and ſtrength in their hands for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing and promoting their old malignant deſignes; yea, the queſtion being directly propounded by the King to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, concerning the employing of theſe men, it was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered negatively in a Letter written to him for that effect; yet after all this, the Commiſsion did at an occaſional Meeting give that Anſwer to the Parliaments Quaere; by which a door was opened to the ſpeedy taking in and employing of all that Party, firſt into the Army, and then into the Judicatories: Concerning which occaſionall Meeting, I deſire to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that notwithſtanding of all that is formerly ſaid, and that it was known that many members of the Commiſſion, and many godly Miniſters and Profeſſors throughout the Land, were in their judgements oppoſite to the imploying and intruſting of theſe men, and that the reſolving to imploy them before ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:166443:41"/>
given to mens conſciences in the point could not but be matter of great ſtumbling and offence, and that a little before that time there had been one or two ſolemn Meetings of the Commiſſion, and that there was a ſet Meeting of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to be within a week or two thereafter, yet was there no mention of that buſineſſe in theſe ſolemn frequent Meetings, and the other ſet Meeting was prevented by that occaſionall Meeting called by the Moderators Letter, upon the deſire of the Parliament, the leading men whereof at that time having long hunted after, and earneſtly preſſed that conjunction, did then on occaſion of the defeat of the Forces at <hi>Hammilton,</hi> drive it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently on, under a pretence of neceſſity; and there were few above a Quorum of the Commiſſion preſent at this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionall Meeting, and many of theſe out of the Synod of <hi>Fife,</hi> who had gone far in the determination of that buſineſſe in their Synod before that time; neither can it be alledged truly that the reſt of the members of the Commiſsion were advertiſed to keep the Diet, becauſe no advertiſement at all was ſent to many in the North, who both might and ought to have been advertiſed; the buſineſſe being of ſo great and common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, and ſo much ſcrupled in conſcience; and the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements for <hi>Sterline, Dumblane, Glaſgow, Dumbartan, Paſley, Hammilton, Irwine, Air, Lanrick</hi> and theſe places, where a great many of the Commiſsioners were, and who were moſt like to ſcrouple at the buſineſſe, came but to <hi>Sterline</hi> on Tueſday about ten a Clock in the forenoon, to keep the Diet of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the next Thurſday thereafter at <hi>Pearth</hi>; and no man can rationally ſay, that theſe advertiſements could be tranſmitted from thence, and the Commiſsioners come thereupon timeouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Pearth</hi> within the ſpace of 48. houres, it being now the Winter ſeaſon, and when the day was about the ſhorteſt; nay, though convenient ſpeed was uſed in diſpatching theſe Letters from <hi>Sterline,</hi> yet the Diet was circumduced before the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement came to ſeveral of the Commiſsioners hands: I am not ignorant that all this is coloured with the neceſsity of a preſent Leavy, becauſe of the defeat of the Forces at <hi>Hammilton,</hi> but to ſay nothing; that that ſeems to preſuppoſe a determination of the queſtion in the affirmitive before it was either propounded
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:166443:42"/>
or debated; neither yet to ſay any thing, that in the conſtruction of too many who did drive on a conjunction with the Malignant party, the neceſsity of a preſent Leavy was not increaſed but rather diminiſhed by the defeat at <hi>Hammilton,</hi> if there was ſuch a neceſsity, then ſuch a courſe ought to have been taken, as was moſt like to bring the buſineſſe ſooneſt to effect, which was to have done things in a fair way, and after mutuall debate and advice of all parties having intereſt, and not thus to have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it without acquainting, let be hearing or ſatisfying of many who were no leſſe intereſſed then they, and whom they knew to have many things to object againſt the imploying of theſe men; but after-carriages did make it plainly to appear, that there was no ſuch preſsing impreſsions of neceſsity as was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, becauſe no great ſpeed was made in the Leavies for ſundry moneths thereafter, and nothing was acted for a long time after the Leavying of the Army, and untill the Act of Claſſes was reſcinded, yea, and untill the Generall Aſſembly was ſet down to interpone their judgements in approving the Publick Reſolutions, which was ſix moneths after giving the anſwer to the <hi>Quare</hi>; and could not that neceſsity that admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of ſo many moneths before execution, have admitted of ſome weeks before reſolution. The Commiſsion having thus determined in this grave and important caſe, did preſently write Letters to Presbyteries, requiring them to concur in their ſtations to make the Leavies effectuall, according to the Order and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions of the Parliament thereanent; which were founded upon the Commiſsions anſwer to the <hi>Quaere,</hi> wherewith ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Presbyteries not being ſatisfied in their conſciences, did write the ground of their ſtumbling and diſ-ſatisfaction in their ſeverall reſpective Letters, and ſent the ſame to the Commiſsion by ſome of their own number, which Letters were not ſpread abroad before they were communicated to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion, and if the Commiſsion had given a ſatisfying anſwer, it is not like that they would have been ſpread at all, but Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries being ſtill preſſed to obedience, without ſatisfaction to their Conſciences, they could not but make known the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their refuſall, leſt they ſhould have ſeemed to others to be wilfull and obſtinate, that they did amongſt themſelves call

That they condemned the Publick Reſolutions as a defection from the Covenant and former Principles, was that which their Duty and their Conſciences called them unto; yet did they no other wayes condemn them then by aſſerting that they conceived them to be ſo, of which aſſertion they did give a reaſon from the Word of GOD, and from the Covenant, and Warnings, Declarations and Remonſtrances of this Church, to which if the Commiſsion had returned a ſatisfactory anſwer, they would have been quiet and ſaid no more in the buſineſſe. That they did not come themſelves and propound their doubts was, becauſe they were many in ſeverall places, whole Presbyteries; &amp; ſuch a way as this ſeemed to them to ſavour rather of tumult and faction then the way which they took, and experience did prove, that no great ſatisfaction was to be expected in that way, becauſe when the Miniſters of <hi>Sterlin</hi> were called by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion to a conference at St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and did not acquieſce to be ſilent &amp; ſay no more againſt the publick reſolutions, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That they did in theſe things traduce honeſt, godly, and faithful Brethren; I think they may with reaſon deny; Theſe Letters contained no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that was perſonall, but only that which concerned the matter of theſe reſolutions, which if it was evill on theſe Brethrens part who were Authors and abettors of the ſame; there is no cauſe to charge thoſe who did endeavour the diſcovery thereof as traducers, or as the doers of theſe things that tend to render their Brethren odious. That they did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent diligently thorough the Country to induce others to do the like, is more then the Author can well prove; but though it had

been ſo, was there not a cauſe to ſtop (if they could) the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of backſlidings and defections, which is as the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of waters, therefore are they well able to clear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before indifferent and impartiall judges of diviſive wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in this matter, notwithſtanding of any thing that is ſaid by the Author in the contrary.</p>

I wiſh the Author may lay as much weight upon the words of that worthy man in other things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Publick reſolutions, as he doth in that ſpeach of his. As to the Authors diſcourſe concerning their taking upon them the Authority of a Publick Judicatory, and declaring perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily that they will ſo do, and condemning the other ſide, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by far the fewer number, and whileſt the matter was yet <hi>ſub judice,</hi> when he ſhall be pleaſed to give us an anſwer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his and other mens taking upon them to be an Aſſembly and to make acts not onely condemning their Brethrens judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but alſo cenſuring them with the ſentences of ſuſpenſion &amp; depoſition, then ſhal an anſwer be given him concerning this. If it be ſaid that they were an lawfull Aſſembly, but the other was no lawfull Commiſsion, that is the queſtion, and if truth be on his ſide, as to the freedome and lawfulneſſe of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly what he ſayeth of their ſetting up of the Commiſsion hath weight; but if that Aſſembly was no Aſſembly, then was the former Commiſsion ſtill ſtanding, and they were in no fault to conveen and exerciſe the ſame; it is true that the matter is <hi>ſub judice</hi>: but was not the matter alſo <hi>ſub judice</hi> betwixt the Meeting at <hi>Dundee,</hi> and the Proteſters when that Meeting took upon them, notwithſtanding of the Proteſtation to be an Aſſembly, and did make acts, cenſuring ſome, and laying an foundation for the cenſuring of all theſe that ſhould refuſe to acknowledge their conſtitution, or after conference oppoſe their Acts. In anſwer to the reſt of his diſcourſe upon this head, I deſire the Reader to take notice, that after ſeverall eſſayes of a conference with the Commiſsion by the Synod of <hi>Glaſgow</hi> to litle or no effect, at the Meeting at <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> theſe who were diſſatisfied with the Publick reſolutions, did offer to the Meeting a humble
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:166443:44"/>
ſuppcation, deſiring them to forbear to conſtitute them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in an Aſſembly, and to adjurne the Meeting untill peaceable and fair means ſhould be uſed for compoſing of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, which was altogether refuſed to be read; then after that the Meeting had conſtitute themſelves in an Aſſembly, it was deſired by theſe brethren that they would appoint ſome of their number to confer with them about differences, which was long &amp; tenaciouſly oppoſed, as carrying with it a reflection upon theſe of the Commiſsion who had carried on the Publick Reſolutions, and a prejudice to the Aſſembly in judging of theſe reſolutions; at laſt the reſult was this, that ſuch of the Aſſembly as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to confer with might ſpeak with them, but that no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon ſhould be nominated, nor any thing written thereof in the minutes of the Aſſembly: In proſecution of this deſire, ſome of the unſatisfied Brethren did meet with the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator of that Aſſembly, and ſome other eminent men mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Commiſsion at Mr. <hi>Robert Blair</hi> his chamber two ſeveral diets, and after ſome conference to and fro, did earneſtly beſeech and preſſe upon them (ſome with tears) that they would be pleaſed to be inſtrumental in adjourning the Aſſembly, and in delaying to ratifie the Publick Reſolutions; but they were not pleaſed to condeſcend ſo much as to undertake to be aſsiſting to theſe brethren in obtaining their deſire, &amp; that night in which the Meeting was adjourned from <hi>St. Andrews</hi> to <hi>Dundee,</hi> the diſ-ſatisfied Brethren did again publickly preſſe that the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly migh be adjourned till ſome conſiderable time, till pains might be taken in an amicable way for compoſing of differences, which being refuſed, they were neceſsitated to Proteſt, as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other remedy againſt the current of backſliding; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this Proteſtation, the Meeting at <hi>Dundee</hi> went on, not onely to the ratifying of the publick reſolutions, but to the condemning of the Proteſtation, cenſuring of ſome of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſters, and making of Acts declaring all of theſe cenſurable who ſhall not acknowledge their conſtitution, and ſubmit to their Acts, and appointing Presbyteries and Synods in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective bounds to proceed to the execution thereof, and giving power to their Commiſsion for that effect where Presbyteries were negligent.

After that time the Lord was pleaſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the Land with ſo ſad diſpenſations, as for a good while made all Publick Meetings of Miniſters very difficult and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, untill the Country being ſomewhat quieted, about the midſt of <hi>October,</hi> theſe who had Proteſted againſt the Meeting at <hi>St. Andrews</hi> and <hi>Dundee,</hi> as not being a lawfull and free Generall Aſſembly, with many other Miniſters and Elders from ſeverall parts of the Country, did meet at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where after ſome dayes ſpent together in Prayer, and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and in confeſsing of their ſins to God, and one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, they did in the next place after conference, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall communication of Light one with another, ſet down their thoughts concerning the Cauſes of the Lords wrath againſt the Land, that in that time of darkneſſe, there might be ſome light and directory in theſe things to ſuch as were willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and make uſe thereof; amongſt theſe cauſes of wrath, they did condeſcend upon and reckon the Publick Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of Church and State, for bringing the Malignant party, firſt to the Army, and then to the Judicatories, and the actuall intruſting of them with the power of the Kingdom both Military and Civil, and the prelimiting and corrupting of the Generall Aſſembly in the free and lawfull conſtitution thereof; and its ratifying of the Publick Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, which did involve a defection from the Cauſe, and laying a foundation for cenſuring of all ſuch who did not approve of the conſtitution of that Aſſembly, and ſubmit to the Acts there of; and finding themſelves more and more convinced of the nullity of that Aſſembly at <hi>Dundee,</hi> and how needfull it was to preſerve the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> in the poſſeſsion of her due priviledges, and to keep together a remnant, who might be as a branch of hope (if ſo be the Lord would be favourable to them, and take pleaſure in them) for repairing of the breach, ſuch of them as were Members of the Commiſsion of the Gen. Aſſembly, did find themſelves warranted and called of God, to take poſſeſsion of the power and truſt committed unto them by the Aſſembly 1650. yet ſo, as they did not authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:166443:45"/>
impoſe or require obedience to any of their Emiſsions concerning the cauſes of the Lords wrath (which was the on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly thing they medled with) but having agreed upon theſe Cauſes, with the advice of diverſe Brethren from ſeverall parts of the Kingdom, did offer and adviſe the ſame to be made uſe of by all the Lords people in the Land leaving place to adde, as the Lord ſhould make further diſcoveries thereafter. At the ſame time all the Brethren who were met, did write Letters to ſundry reverend and godly men in the Miniſtery, of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent judgment, deſiring an amicable Conference with them; and conceiving that they could not well be brought together to one place in ſuch a ſeaſon of the year, and when travelling was ſo difficult, they did appoint ſome of their number to wait upon ſome of them at St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and upon others of them at <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> who might hold forth unto them what in their judgments was the moſt conducible means for union and peace both with God and among our ſelves, and to hear what ſhould be offered unto them by theſe Brethren; what paſſed in theſe Conferences, I leave it to theſe who were preſent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, hoping that none who were preſent will ſay, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and endeavors of union did break off upon our ſide; thoſe of our number not only profeſsing themſelvs willing to confer &amp; hear what ſhould be offred unto them, but to attend at any other diet that ſhould be appointed, and to endeavour if it were deſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red, a more numerous and frequent meeting of Brethren of both ſides: From all which it doth appear, that the Proteſters all along, have been purſuers of peace, and not promoters and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterers of diviſion. The Author propounds the queſtion, If it had not been a more probable and Chriſtian like mean for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medying the diviſions, to have dealt for a meeting of judicious and godly men on both ſides, and for an amicable and brotherly Conference on equal tearms about the differences, then that the Proteſters being but the one ſide, ſhould have taken upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the authority of a Publick Judicatory, and by themſelvs ſtraightway to condemne the other ſide as guilty. In anſwer to which, beſide what is already ſaid, I would firſt ask the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, Whether it be fair dealing, that theſe at St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were earneſtly entreated of their Brethren, to adjourn
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:166443:46"/>
and delay the ratifying of the Publick Reſolutions, ſhall firſt take upon them the Authority of a Generall Aſſembly, to rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Publick Reſolutions, condemne their Brethren who proteſt againſt them, cenſure ſome of them with Suſpenſion, and others of them with Depoſition for that very thing, and lay a foundation for cenſuring all of them, and all others in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who ſhould continue to differ from them, and oppoſe them in theſe things, and then afterwards cry out upon their Brethren, who hold forth the ſin and iniquity of ſuch proceedings, as upon men who are not for peace, and do not take the moſt probable and Chriſtian-like mean for reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying the diviſions; The Author knowes who were in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who did tread theſe ſteps not long ago: Next, they did conceive it to be the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable and Chriſtian-like mean for remedying the diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to fall upon the root of the matter, by holding ing forth that which had divided us from God, and God from us, and one of us from another, taking this for the moſt genuine and ſound, &amp; ſafe, &amp; Chriſtian method of proceeding, yet walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo therein, as that they did onely ſoberly and by way of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice hold forth their judgmnts, and not impoſe upon any; and as they left an open door to others, to adde what further diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of guiltineſs the Lord ſhould make known to them, ſo were they as ſharp and ſearching againſt themſelves, as againſt any others. What diſſonancie from their Profeſsion is in all this, and if it be but a mocking of God (as the Author inſinuats) I hope and pray, that the Lord will reveal it unto them, ſeeing they did it in the ſimplicity of their hearts, looking upon the ſame as a ſpeciall and neceſſary point of their duty, in this day of indignation and back-ſliding; but if it was acceptable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to God, as I truſt it was, I hope the Lord wil countenance and follow it with a bleſsing from Heaven, that there may be a profitable fruit thereof to his poor ſervants, and to his poor Church. I know not well who theſe be of whom the Author ſpeaks, who notwithſtanding of all the buſineſſe that is made upon conferences about differences &amp;c. yet if the fears of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, both godly and wiſe may have weight, have no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe but ſo far as they can to ſtrengthen themſelves in their

It may be inſinuat there, where they ſay, that the faithfull Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt in former times brought the Work of Reformation to a great perfection, and to a near conformity with the firſt patern; for theſe epithets of great and near cannot be looked on in this place, but as <hi>termini dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuentes,</hi> becauſe perfection &amp; conformity to a rule, are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their own pure ſignification, ſuch terms as no epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet of quantity in the meer poſitive degree can be added to them without diminution of the thing ſignified by them When you ſay, an action is come to a great perfection, and to a conformi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To ſay nothing, that the Work of Reformation is capable of a greater grouth in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall uſe of the things that are known and profeſt, and of a diſcovery of further degrees of light and perſwaſion in theſe things. Will the Author ſay, that nothing at all, no not the leaſt pin or circumſtance of perfection &amp; conformity with the firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, was then wanting to the work of reformation in <hi>Scotland,</hi> if ſo we deſire him to tell us, what kind of power it is that is exerciſed by the Magiſtrates and Councels of Burghs then they chooſe Commiſſioners to the Generall Aſſembly, and what is the extent of the Doctors Office? I ask not theſe things to caſt any blemiſh on the Work of Reformation, which I do willingly acknowledge to be ſuch as may compare with any of the Reformed Churches, and in ſome reſpect (ſo far as I know) hath the pre-eminence, but to ſatisfie the Authors need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe curioſity, theſe things being conſidered, makes it to appear, that theſe words even when ſtreached upon the tenter-hooks of the Authors nicety, do yet bear a convenient and true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that none needs thence to fear a ſerpent lurking in the buſh. I acknowledge that it hath been the way of ſome in theſe Lands ſince the Work of Reformation began in them, to ſay, that the Work of Reformation in <hi>Scotland,</hi> was a good way on, but that there are yet further attainments then it was brought unto; but it was apparent from others of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and from the whole tenor of their carriage, that they had therein a bad meaning, to wit, that we ſhould not hold faſt the things which we have already, nor walk by the ſame rule, but that we ſhould make an alteration and change thereof; and therefore there is reaſon to be jealous over ſuch; but to be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous over theſe whoſe expreſsiſions &amp; carriage gives no ground for it, is but to torment our ſelves with needleſſe fears, and to wrong others. I have already given ſome accompt of the Paper preſented to the Meeting at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> (which the Author doth here repeat again) and ſhall now adde theſe

Firſt, that Paper was not preſented to a Meeting that either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally was or did pretend to be the Commiſsion of the Church, but onely to a Meeting of Miniſters and Profeſſors, acting not in the capacity of any Judicatory reall or pretended. Secondly, that all the Miniſters who were there, did teſtifie their diſlike of that Paper, and even theſe whom the Author and ſome others do haply moſt ſuſpect, did ſeriouſly diſſwade from the in-giving of it. Thirdly, I know not who is the <hi>Joab</hi> he means of; but I do well know, that the men of that Meeting who are moſt ſlandered as the plotters and contrivers of ſuch things, had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther head, nor hand, nor heart in that Paper; and if I rightly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, I heard it aſſerted by the Author of it, there was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther head nor pen in it but his own; theſe who know him wel, may think that he hath that much ability as to reach the ſtile, contrivance and concept<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Author is pleaſed to alledge, the Proteſters do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe any of thoſe who have been honoured of God, to ſtand conſtant againſt Prelats uſurpations, and for the Liberties of Aſſemblies, they acknowledge that they owe much to ſuch, and though they cannot but teſtifie againſt the ill of the Publick Reſolutions, yet they do retain a honourable Impreſſion of theſe perſons, and of what is good in them. 6. If it were fit to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, ſundry of the Proteſters are in nothing; yea, in none of theſe things which the Author mentioned as praiſe worthy, behinde with the very chief of theſe who have appeared for the Publick Reſolutions, but both of them are by the grace of God, that that they are. 7. That none of the Proteſteers for any thing that I know, did take unwarrantable orders from the Prelats, and do more to accept one who hath often in private, and in Publick acknowledged, and is ſtill ready to acknowledge the ſin of that way in which he was bred up from his youth, and therefore did it ignorantly through unbelief, who becauſe of the exceeding riches of the mercy of God, in recovering him out of that ſnare holds himſelf the more bound to be vigilant and zealous againſt all deſertions for the time to come; this man hath forbidden me to ſay any more to the Author, in anſwer to theſe things; but theſe words, <hi>dignus ego qui patior indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus tu qui faceres tamen,</hi> and to leave the explication to his own conſcience. 8. It had been fairer dealing in the Author, to have diſcovered or named the Prelaticall ſteps that ſome of the Proteſters have troden theſe years paſt, and not thus to have aſſerted without any proof or inſtance, which he thinks a fault in matters of leſſe moment: The ſteps that theſe men have tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

                     <p>THeir firſt reaſon for unfreeneſſe, and unlawfulneſſe of the Aſſembly, that the Election of Commiſsioners to the ſame was prelimited and prejudged in the due liberty thereof, by an Act &amp; Letter of their Commiſsion of the laſt Aſſembly ſent to Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, appointing ſuch Brethren as after Conference remained unſatisfied with, and continued to oppoſe Publick Reſolutions to be cited to the Gen. Aſſembly. Thus it is briefly proponed in the Proteſtation. In the late larger paper emitted and ſpread abroad ſince, wherein as may be conceived, are muſtered all the Forces that could be gathered together againſt that Aſſembly, and many heads have been imployed in that one, every man that readeth it decerneth whoſe Pen hath given the forme and frame to it; and any decerning man alſo may perceive in it ſomething of School, and ſomething of Law and regiſters which the former behoved to have from theſe quarriers. It is put in a Sy logiſtick form thus: That it is no free Generall Aſſembly, the Election of whoſe Commiſſioners is ſo prejudged and pre-limited in the due freedom and liberty thereof, that many Miniſters of Presbyteries in a capacity to be choſen, for their ability and faithfulneſſe are by
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:166443:52"/>
the Presbyteries at the order of the Supream Judicatory paſt by and ſet aſide in the Election, and rendred uncapable to be members thereof; But the late Meeting is ſuch: Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We wil not follow out foot for foot the tract of many objections which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers of this Paper have either found ſome way made by others, or have formed themſelves at their own pleaſure againſt this and other following reaſons, and their replyes thereunto. But ſhall propone ſuch reaſens as we conceive diſcovers the nullity of theſe and other reaſons, not omitting the conſideration of any thing contained in this Paper which ſhall ſeem to meet with what we ſhall bring as occaſion ſhall be offered without tying our ſelves to the order of this Paper: For anſwer then to this firſt ground. <hi>1.</hi> As it lyeth in the Proteſtation, it could have no force to prove any illegality or nullity of the Aſsembly at the time of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation; ſuppoſe that the Commiſſioners Act &amp; Letter ſent to Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries and indeed contained under Prelimitation, becauſe this fault of the Commiſsion could not be imputed to the Aſſembly to nullifie it, while as yet it was to the knowledge of the Aſsem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, but an aliedgance not proven, that ſuch under pre-limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had been uſed in the election of Commiſsioners, and that they had not as yet determined nor approven the deed of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion, nor deed of Presbyteries done thereupon in elections; at the giving in of this Proteſtation the Aſsembly had not as yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the Commiſsioners Proceedings, neither indeed was it in their power to cognoſce upon exceptions againſt the Commiſſion, without change of the Order of proceeding that had been uſed conſtantly in all bygone time, and upon a great debate with the Parliament it ſelf in the Aſsembly <hi>1648.</hi> had been eſtabliſhed by a formall act, as the Proteſters themſelves well underſtood and acknowledged, and therefore it was, that upon this they offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Aſsembly, before the chooſing of a Moderator, a Paper preſſing the changing, and reform the order of proceeding in the Generall Aſsembly, which before had alwayes been in uſe, as if ſome of themſelves had not been the main maintainers and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curers of the eſtabliſhment of that order before, when it made for them.

The truth is, that if it were a purpoſe to tell it, there were very few heads imployed in that buſineſſe; haply as few as about the Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and there was little gathering of forces for it, the difficulty of correſpondence and ſhortneſſe of time wherein it was penned admitting of very little communication of thoughts; and the Author is miſtaken when he ſpeaks of two Quaeres, one of School, another of Regiſters and of Law, out of which the former behoved to have his materials, and haply alſo concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pen that gave it the frame, as ſome others have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; but what though all theſe things were true which he alleadgeth: Is it any fault in weak Souldiers to call in their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows to their help, and to ſtrengthen one another in maintaining of their ground againſt many and ſtrong Adverſaries; or doth he hunt after commendation and applauſe, by ſetting forth the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, and multitude and ſtrength of his oppoſites, whom yet he by himſelf alone ſuppoſeth to have defeat. It was free for the Author in anſwering the reaſons contained in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, and the other Paper relating to it, to chooſe ſuch a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod as ſeemed beſt to him, though it would have ſeemed to be more eaſie for his readers, if he had followed foot for foot what is contained in theſe Papers; I do more wonder that he hath left many things of importance unanſwered, not ſo much as once touching them. But let us come to the anſwers which he gives, which I ſhall take as they ly in the Vindication, upon ſuppoſal that the Letter and act ſent by the Commiſsion to Presbyteries, did contain an under-prelimitation; the firſt ground as it lyeth in the Proteſtation, hath force to prove the illegality, or nudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Aſſembly, notwithſtanding of any thing the Author ſaith to the contrary. Firſt, he ſeems to lay this ground, that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:166443:53"/>
nothing can be of force to prove the illegality, or nullity of the Aſſembly, but that which can be imputed to the Aſſembly it ſelf; but I fear that this ground which is here hinted at by him, and much made uſe of by ſome others in this particular, ſhall fail all who lean thereupon: I ſuppoſe that by a Letter and Act of the Commiſſion, and a deed of the Presbyteries done there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, elections had been ſo pre-limited, that al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> Ruling Elders had been excluded, and Miniſters onely choſen, or the one half of the Miniſters excluded, without a juſt cauſe from having voice in the elections, or from being choſen Commiſsioners; would not theſe pre-limitations have force to prove a nul Aſſembly, the ſame being proponed and rejected as not relevant exceptions, when the Commiſsioners did meet to conſtitute themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Aſſembly; it ſeems by the Authors ground they could not, becauſe they are but alledgeances not yet proven, and they have not determined therein, no approven thereof, becauſe it is not in their power to cognoſce upon exceptions againſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion, without change of the order of Proceedings to the Aſſ. which had been conſtantly uſed in all time by gone; there may be many things done in Commiſsions &amp; Presbyteries in prelimiting and perverting the elections, that cannot be imputed; yea, which the Aſſembly may condemn, that may make an illegall and null Aſſembly; and therefore upon ſuppoſall that the Letter and Act ſent to Presbyteries did contain an under-pre-limitation, it might have force at the time of the Proteſtation to prove a null Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, though it could not be imputed to the Aſſembly it ſelf: But how doth he prove that it could not be imputed to the Aſſembly? firſt, it was (ſaith he) to the knowledge of the Aſſembly, but an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeance not proven; it ſeems the Author doth not queſtion the relevancie of it in <hi>Jure,</hi> if the truth of the fact had been proven, but it being relevant in <hi>Jure</hi> (as upon his ſuppoſall it needs muſt) and offered to be proven in <hi>facto</hi>; yea, the matter of fact, as to the preſumption of it, being manifeſt to the conſciences of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Aſſembly, ought they not before conſtituting themſelvs in an Aſſembly, either to have tryed and diſcuſſed the ſame, or elſe to have laid aſide the perſons againſt whom it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, from ſitting as Members in the Aſſembly, untill it might have been gotten tryed and diſcuſſed; but they did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:166443:53"/>
of theſe, and was not this to be imputed to the Aſſembly? Next, he ſayeth, that the Aſſembly had not yet determined in, nor approven the deed of the Commiſſion, nor the deed of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries done thereupon in Elections, at the giving in of the Proteſtation: B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>t in this he is much miſtaken, becauſe the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly by admitting the Commiſſioners from Presbyteries ſo elected, did as really approve theſe limited Elections, and ſo the deed of the Commiſsion and Presbyteries done thereupon, as ever any preceeding Aſſem. uſed to approve the moſt free Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; to wit, onely by admitting the Commiſſioners; yea, the Aſſemb. rejecting of the exceptions, and allowing the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners againſt whom it was propounded, to ſit notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the propounding thereof, was a real approving of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and of what the Presbyteries did thereupon, as we ſhal afterwards Godwilling clearly ſhew. Thirdly, he ſayeth, that the Aſſembly had not yet conſidered the proceedings of the Commiſsion, neither was it in their power to cognoſce upon exceptions againſt the Commiſsion, without change of the order of proceedings, which had been uſed conſtantly in all time by-gone, This is a pretty fancie to defend an ill cauſe: the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> have found it neceſſary in the intervall betwixt Generall Aſſemblies, to have her Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, whoſe truſt ſhould be to preſerve the Liberties of the Church and to take care of ſome things of more General con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment committed unto them, and that in all theſe things they ſhould keep themſelves within the bounds of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion, and proceeding according to the ſtanding Acts of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Generall Aſſemblies, and that in the next enſuing Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly they ſhall give an accompt of their proceedings during the whole time of their Commiſsion in the beginning of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, before any other Cauſe or matter be handled, and their proceedings to be allowed or diſ-allowed, as the Aſſembly ſhall think expedient. Now, ſaith the Author, this matter of pre-limitation being an exception againſt the Commiſsion, could not be taken in conſideration, without the change of this order. I ſhall not ſay, that it might have been done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſhadow of change of order; But I deſire to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that it never was the intention, nor did it ever come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:166443:54"/>
the mind of any free lawfull Generall Aſſembly of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to give power to their Commiſsioners to give Lawes concerning the conſtitutng of an Aſſembly; theſe are clearly ſet down in the Policy and Acts of the Church, according to which, the Commiſsion ought to walk in all things committed to their truſt, not medling with any thing not committed unto them, much leſs medling with it in a way contrary to that Policy &amp; theſe Acts: and therefore did they appoint the proceedings of theſe Commiſsioners to be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and allowed or diſ-allowed in the next Aſſembly, before the doing of any thing elſe. Now a Commiſsion contrary to their truſt, doth meddle with the Conſtitution of an Aſſembly, and by their Letter and Act, and the deed of Presbyteries thereupon, the elections are prelimited (as the Author is content to ſuppoſe) and when the Aſſembly meets, and this is proponed as an exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption to be taken in conſideration againſt ſuch Members of the Aſſ: as was Members of that Commiſsion; he tels us, it cannot be conſidered without change of order, being an exception againſt the Commiſsioners proceedings.

If there was any queſtion about that Act, it could not but be readily acknowledged by the Proteſters, having been ſo lately revived in the Aſſem. 1648. but that there was any ſuch acknowledgment as the Author inſinuates, is alleadged without all ground; as alſo that which he ſayeth of their offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a Paper for changing of their former order; They did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver offer any ſuch Paper, nor did they ever pen or draw up any ſuch Paper; and the Author doth wrong them not a little, and himſelf more, when he doth affirm it: They did indeed offer a Paper to the Aſſembly, before the chooſing of the Moderator, but there was not one title therein concerning the changeing and Reforming of the order of proceeding formerly uſed by the Aſſembly; but upon knowledge and conſcience of the main weight that lay againſt that Meeting, why they could not be a lawfull, free Generall Aſſembly; the Proteſters did offer a Paper unto them for chooſing of the Moderator, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining

a humble deſire, and ſome reaſons to perſwade them to adjourn their Meeting, and to forbear to conſtitute themſelves in an Aſſembly; the Paper is yet extant under the hands of all the Proteſters, and may be ſeen by any who pleaſe.

That the election of Commiſſioners to the Aſſembly was prejudged and prelimited in the due freedom thereof: That this alleadgeance might be verified, it was neceſſary to have made clearly out; Firſt, That the Commiſſioners Act and Letter exclude and diſcharge many Miniſters to be choſen. Secondly, That the Presbytery in the Election, were poſsibly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited by the Letter of the Commiſsion, <hi>i. e.</hi> admitted the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limitation of the Commiſſioners, and did not uſe their own free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in electing, but meerly followed the direction of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; let the Commiſſion be never ſo guilty, and their brethren never ſo unduely prelimited, yet if the Presbyteries who are the only Electors uſed their own freedom, their election is free and valid, and nothing can be forced againſt the Aſſembly as unfree and unlegall in the conſtitution of it, becauſe of any ſuch Act or Letter of the Commiſsions, as ſolicitation active of Judges and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:166443:56"/>
Members of any Judicatory, proves not a Judicatory corrupt, unleſſe it can be evidenced, that they have excepted and yeelded unto the ſolicitation. Now, doth this Paper prove either of theſe as it undertakes, and would bear the Reader in hand, when it ſayeth, The ſecond Propoſition is proven, &amp;c. good and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Reader; conſider if it do ſo. And firſt for the latter of theſe particulars what ſayeth it? The ſecond is proven by the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries proceeding according to the Letter and Act of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſent unto them about the time of chooſing the Commiſsioners appointing that ſuch, &amp;c.

It is but words he gives his Reader in the cloſe of that Section, ſaying theſe things do clearly prove that there was ſuch a prelimitation of Election as is formerly ſpoken of; For, let theſe things be never ſo clear ſpoken of the Commiſsions Act and Letter, yet for ought that he ſaid as yet, it is not clear, that Presbyteries proceeded accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to theſe, or were poſitively prelimited by them, that they did not uſe their own liberty in election, and ſo the ſecond Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not yet proved.</p>

I ſhall alſo paſſe it, conceiving that he takes it for a truth, as indeed it is. To the Aſſumption he ſayeth many things, which I ſhall take in order as they lye. Let it be yeelded to him, that for verification of the alleadgeance contained therein, that theſe two things which he mentions are to be made out, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Letter and Act of the Commiſsion did exclude and diſcharge many Miniſters to be choſen, and that the Presbyteries did admit of that prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or were paſsively prelimited by that Letter and Act, yet with theſe animadverſions upon that which he ſpeaks in the explication of his paſsive prelimitation: Firſt, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines his paſsive prelimitation within too narrow a bounds, and he will not have it extended to the Presbyteries, unleſſe they did meerly follow the Election of the Commiſsion in that matter that is as I take his meaning, go quite contrary to their own inclination and judgment, ſo as they were but meer pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents in that buſineſs, (upon which accompt a wrangler might haply deny that there is any prelimitation at all of Elections: for if men be ſuffered to make any election, or ſo patients in it, that if they had been left to themſelves, they would have taken another courſe: But what if they had ſome inclinations that way, yet were not herein fully determined, but were hovering and ſuſpending the ultimate determination of their judgment, untill they ſhould hear the matter debated in their Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or adviſe and confer with others of their Brethren abroad, and then the Letter and Act of the Commiſſion comes unto them, and by the authority hereof, determines that judgment, and ſhuts out all that thereafter could be ſaid by any to the contrary. Was there not a paſſive prelimitation here, though ſuch perſons did not meerly follow the direction of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, but alſo in ſome part their own inclination, which I think indeed was the caſe of many of the Presbyteries.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:166443:58"/>
were not paſſively prelimited, but did choice freely: The firſt is, that a great part of the Presbyteries four parts of five at that time had no oppoſite to the Publick Reſolutions amongſt them, and ſo were not capable by prelimitation to exclude whom they had not; what though it were true that as many Presbyteries as he ſpeaks of had no oppoſit at that time to the Publick Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet what if all, or ſome of theſe Presbyteries had in them ſome few or many, who were as yet indifferent, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in the buſineſſe; but were afterwards overſwayed with the Authority of the Commiſſioners Letter and Act; was there not a prelimitation upon them in their voicing in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Commiſsioners, becauſe overſwayed by the Letter and Act of the Commiſsion to choſe theſe who did approve of the Publick Reſolutions, which before the influence that that Letter and Act had upon them, they were not determined in, but might haply have been determined in the contrary, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuppoſal that many were indifferent at that time in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Publick Reſolutions, as indeed not a few were if we may judge by their carriage, becauſe they had not declared their judgements for or againſt them; who knowes but they might before the elections, have been determined againſt them? If by the Letter and Act of the Commiſsion that gave evidence of proceſſing ſuch, they had not been prelimited in their choice, and ſo there ſhould have been ſome oppoſite to the Publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions in theſe Presbyteries, had it not been for that prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. 2. I think he will not deny, but ſome Presbyteries had in them oppoſites to Publick Reſolutions; Let us take (as it would ſeem he would grant it) a fifth part, there might be a prelimitation upon theſe, and to prelimite the elections in every fifth Presbytery of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> is certainly a great blow to the freedome of the Aſſembly. But 3. I affirm and make good, that it is not true that four parts of five of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries at that time had in them no oppoſite to Publick Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions; yea, on the contrary, that the one half of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries in Scotland and above, had in them at that time ſome oppoſites to Publick Reſolutions.

It may be the Author will queſtion whether all theſe were oppoſite at that time to the Publick Reſolutions: But I believe the truth of this, concerning as many of them as will make him after ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Coppie which I have in this place wants ſome words, and hath ſomething wrong written, of which I cannot well make ſenſe, but theſe words which I have cited are plainly ſet down in it. The 2. thing that he brings that Presbyteries were not poſitively pre-limited, is, that of theſe Presbyteries who had oppoſites to the Publick Reſolutions, the far moſt part did chooſe ſuch, and that few did paſſe by them in the elections, But this overſhuts as far as the other, as will appear by view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the number of Presbyteries, in wich there were ſome oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites to the Publick Reſolutions; and conſidering how many of theſe were, in which there were any choſen who were againſt theſe Reſolutions, which I believe ſhall not be found above 20.

The Author doth readily avow, that where Presbyteries did paſs by ſuch they did it meerly of their own accord, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the freedome of their own minde, without all pre-limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from without; if he had ſo readily avowed it, he ſhould have brought good proof of it, that men might have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that he did avowe a truth; his proof is, that the contrary is not proven: Though it were ſo, that it is not good proof of what he avows. Next he ſaith, that he can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the affirmitive of ſome who did paſſe by ſuch ere that Act and Letter came unto them, but how many they are he tels us not, leſt the paucity of them being known, ſhould make little to the purpoſe, very few elections in <hi>Scotland</hi> were paſt, before that Letter and Act came unto them, it being iſſued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ordinary time of election, and great diligence and care being uſed in the diſpatch thereof, ſo that came to the hands of the moſt remote Presbyteries, who lay under the feet of the Enemy, ſuch as theſe of <hi>Merſe, Tividale, Dumfriece</hi> and <hi>Gallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> before their elections, that in ſome few places the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons was made before it came, is far from proving what he doth readily avow, as the comming of an ſwallow is far from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſpring in ſome places, ſome were acquainted that there was ſuch a purpoſe and deſign, before it was jud<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

To the matter of this inſtance, we ſay theſe things: <hi>1.</hi> It is too wide a word, All the Miniſters who oppoſe the Publick Reſolutions are known to be, &amp;c. And how ever, many of them will not be queſtioned to be ſuch; yet we muſt ſay ſome, even of theſe were not ſo faithfull as they ſhould have been this laſt year by paſt, in
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:166443:60"/>
the particular of defence of Countrey and Covenant in all the ſworn Articles thereof; This the Nation feels to day, and the poſterity when this generation is dead and rotten, will give im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall judgement of it. <hi>2.</hi> Be it ſo, that ſome were wont to be choſen Commiſsioners were not now choſen, yet this is for little purpoſe to the point, that the election was carried by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the Commiſsions Letter, that theſe ſame men have wont to be often choſen without intermiſsion to be Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, the whole Kirk was growing ſenſible of this thing as dangerous, whereby the whole power of Publick Government was nigh by become ſettled in the perſons of ſome particular men, and theſe but a few as conſtant Commiſsioners of the Kirk. If ever the Lord ſhall be pleaſed to grant again to this Kirk the Liberty of a generall Aſſembly, it were neceſſary that Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries be pre-limited indeed, that they make not ſuch an uſe and wont. <hi>3.</hi> That few oppoſites were choſen; it is no wonder becauſe they were but few in compariſon of the reſt of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of <hi>Scotland. 4.</hi> Even where neither whole ſocieties were unanimous againſt the Reſolutions, nor yet the plurality were oppoſers, yet ſome unſatisfied were choſen Commiſsioners with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a certain election, and without Proteſtation (diſſenting in the enumeration is idlely reckoned up) as is evident from the Commiſsioners, both of the Presbytery and univerſity of <hi>Aberdeen.</hi> There was indeed a Proteſtation againſt the oppoſing Brother, but it was taken up and paſſed from and the election unanimouſly approven afterwards in the Presbytery, ſo there is ſomething againſt the truth clearly. <hi>5.</hi> The writer makes enumeration of elections of Presbyteries divided in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſome doubted, ſome diſſented from, or Proteſted againſt, ſome both wayes, but gives no particular inſtances of all theſe ſorts but onely of two, theſe of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> and <hi>Sterline;</hi> and I ſuſpect he can give us no more or very few. But ſixthly to the main drift of this inſtance expreſsed in the laſt words thereof, of all which no reaſon can be given, except the Act and Letter of the Commiſsion: We anſwer, this is a very poor way of proving, that the Letter and Act of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion had much influence upon the election of Commiſsioners, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a man denying it, to ſay no other reaſon can be given

                        <p>BEcauſe ſomething ſeems to the Author to be ſaid again what is now alleadged in the Writer his Reply to the third Objection that he forms againſt his own Argument. The Author takes theſe things in conſideration, and gives ſome An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers unto them, but let us ſee what they are. Firſt, he thinks it too wide a word to ſay, That all the Miniſters who did op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Publick Reſolutions, are known to be faithfull and honeſt, and he gives an inſtance in the carriage of ſome of them that ſeems to weaken this teſtimony, his inſtance is, that ſome of theſe were not ſo faithfull as they ſhould have been this laſt year paſt in the particular of the Defence of the Countrey and Covenant: but what is this but a branch of the thing that is in Controverſie? Theſe Miniſters are perſwaded in their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences before the Lord upon good reaſon, that it would have been in them great unfaithfulneſſe to have allowed of that way of the Defence of the Countrey and Covenant holden forth in the Publick Reſolutions, and that beſides all their provocations which are great and many, they would by this alſo have been acceſſory to what the Nation ſmarts under this day, as the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous reward of ſuch revolting from God; and therefore if ye have no more to inſtance but this, it doth not prove, but that they may all of them be ſtill called faithfull and honeſt men. Secondly he ſayeth, Be it ſo that ſome were wont to be choſen Commiſſioners, who were not now choſen, yet this is litle to the point, that Elections was carryed by influence of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions Letter and Act. But granting that Presbyteries did

upon that Letter and Act, leave their wonted way theſe years paſt in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ir Election, it is to the point in hand, becauſe it is <hi>praeſumptio juris, &amp; de jure</hi>; that this change flowed from the influence that the Letter and Act had upon them, the Author ſeeing ſomewhat of this, intimates another cauſe that moved that change, to wit, that the whole Kirk was growing ſenſible of this thing, as dangerous, whereby the whole power of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Government, was near become ſettled in the perſons of ſome particular men, and theſe but a few, as conſtant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsioners, in which he thinks there will be need to pre-li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite Presbyteries, that they make not an uſe of it. If the Lord ſhall be pleaſed again to grant the Liberty of an Aſſembly. But to ſay nothing, that this was the language which was wont to be ſpoken by diſ-affected men theſe years paſt, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſ-affected Miniſters, who fell under the cenſures of the Church, whoſe pretences and alleadgeances in this particular have ſtrength added unto them by the Authors aſſerting the ſame thing: It is <hi>non cauſa pro cauſa,</hi> as will appear by theſe two things; Firſt, there were a good many of theſe who were for the Publick Reſolutions, who had wont to be Commiſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners theſe years paſt, and who had a great, ſome of them a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſwey in Government than the other, and yet moſt, if not all of theſe were choſen alſo the laſt year. Now, if that was the cauſe which the Author ſpeaks of, why did it not bring forth the like effect in regard of both, ſeeing both were alike lyable to that exception. Next, if the whole Church was ſo grown in the ſenſe of that evill, why did they not provide the remedy at the laſt Aſſembly, it being in their power ſo to have done, and the Commiſsioners (as the Authors aſſertion will import) having ſuch an impreſsion of the ſame upon their ſpirits? If the Author will ſpeak his Conſcience, I think he will not deny, but if theſe men whom he ſaith to have been excluded upon that ground, have been for the Publick Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, even theſe amongſt them whom that ground might have been conceived to reach moſt, would have been choſen and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:166443:62"/>
for the Presbytery, by his own grant, there was a Proteſtation againſt the oppoſing Brother who was choſen, which was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up again with much difficulty, and by earneſt dealing of ſome of the Brethren, oppoſite to the Publick Reſolutions, whoſe deſire was condeſcended unto, with condition, that their ſhould be a third Commiſsioner, it being in the mean while ſuggeſted in private, that he who had firſt appeared in the Proteſtation againſt the oppoſers, might be the man, which I relate not upon hear-ſay, but upon the ſubſcribed teſtimony of theſe who were witneſſes to the matter of fact. So I hope, that nothing againſt the truth hath been aſſerted by the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in this part of his Anſwer. The Author ſayeth in a Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, that diſſenting in the enumeration, is idlely reckoned up. Why he ſhould ſay ſo, I do not conjecture, unleſſe that it be he thinks diſſenting and proteſting the ſame thing which they are not, as appears clearly from an Act of the Aſſembly 1644. concerning diſſent and Proteſtations in Presbyteries. He ſeems unſatisfied with the Writer, that whilſt he makes enumeration of elections of Presbyteries divided in judgment, ſome doubted, ſome diſſented from, or proteſted againſt, ſome both wayes, that he gives no particular inſtances of all theſe ſorts, but only two, and he tells his Reader, that he ſuſpects he can give no more, or very few. But he is ſuſpicious without cauſe, moe can be given and are given by the Writer in that very Paper that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is replying to, and moe then all theſe can yet be given if need be: And though they were but few, this is no great wonder, becauſe there was but few Presbyteries did chooſe any oppoſite to the Publick Reſolutions, or according to the Author, could chooſe any ſuch, becauſe they had none ſuch amongſt them. Whereas he ſayeth, that it is a poor way of proving the Act and Letter of the Commiſsion to have had much influence upon the Election of Commiſsioners, to ſay, that of all this, no other reaſon can be given, becauſe it is no more; but when you have affirmed a thing, to ſay, that the Adverſary cannot prove the negative, whereas <hi>affirme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As to that perſon that made them diſpenſe with the Letter and Act of the Commiſsion: He was precious and dear to the godly who knew him in all parts of the Land for his tenderneſſe and piety, and was but lately looſed from the bonds of his captivity, and if they had rejected him, it would have been a great imputation upon them, to ſay nothing that their deſigne had been more open and manifeſt: yet the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor cannot but remember, that notwithſtanding he was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen both by them, and alſo in the firſt election, yet was it refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to let him ſit in the Aſſemblie, till that reaſon ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:166443:65"/>
as he believes theſe ſame whom they had choſen before, &amp;c. But notwithſtanding of all the Author ſays, there is very much to the purpoſe in it. Firſt, there is this in it to the purpoſe, that the judgments and voices of ſome of the Members of the Presbytery, <hi>viz.</hi> of theſe who did diſſent from the firſt election were pre-limited by the Letter and Act of the Commiſſion, they giving theſe onely for the reaſon of their diſſent. Secondly, there is this in it to the purpoſe, that the judgment of the whole Synod, which doth include five Presbyteries (except a few who did diſſent from, and Proteſt againſt the Synod, ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the diſſent of theſe in <hi>Dunkel</hi> from the Election upon that ground) was by the ſame Letter and Act pre-limited to the declaring of that Election void and null, meerly upon this reaſon, that they had proc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>eded contrary to the Letter and Act of the Commiſſion. Thirdly, there is this to the purpoſe in it, that the whole Presbyterie was ſo pre-limited by an Act of the Synod, founded on the other Act and Letter, as to be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate to paſſe from the firſt Election which was lawfully made, and againſt which no exception was made, but the Letter and Act; and to make a new Election, that they did again chooſe perſons oppoſite to the Publick Reſolutions, was from the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing Conſcience of their duty. That they were admitted in the Aſſembly without any queſtion, is not true; their admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was queſtioned by a Member of the Commiſſion, then a Member of the Aſſembly, a man zealous for the Publick Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions; and the Moderator perceiving that others oppoſite to the Publick Reſolutions were like to take advantage by it, he did handſomely wave it. Now, theſe things being examined which the Author ſayeth to the firſt part of the Aſſumption, I leave it to be judged whether he had cauſe to ſay, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever pre-limitations were in the Commiſsions Act and Letter, yet the Elections were free, becauſe Presbyteries therein were not paſsively pre-limited but choſen freely according to their own minde; and whether he had cauſe to draw ſo ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting lines as he ſubjoyns thereto.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:166443:66"/>
the pretended Aſſembly at Glaſgow 1610. intimateteth that they were choſen and had Commiſsions, becauſe it ſaith Firſt, that the elections were not free; an election then there was, but not a free election; if there had been no election, the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly 38. would, no queſtion, have ſo expreſſed it, as importing a reaſon of nullity more clear and ſtrong. Next, that the Biſhop of <hi>St. Andrews</hi> required them to ſend ſuch Commiſsioners as the King had nominate, aſſuring them that no other would be accepted; If the Presbyteries did ſend them as their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, then ſome ſort of election there behoved to be, as indeed there was, both to that Aſſembly at <hi>Lithgow</hi> 1606. and that of <hi>Glaſgow</hi> 1610. For clearing of which, it would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, that there is an election materiall, when perſons are inſtructed and authorized by us as our Commiſsioners, though we have not nominate and formally choſen them for that effect, and an election formal, when we do formally nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and chooſe, an election materiall there was at <hi>Lithgow,</hi> becauſe thoſe who were nominate by the Kings Letter, were inſtructed and authorized by the Presbyteries as their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners; and therefore in the 4. reaſon for nullifying of that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, there is mention of the power which theſe Miniſters had, and of the limitation thereof by their Presbyteries; but there was no formal nomination of theſe men by the Presbyteries, therefore it is ſaid in the 2. reaſon, that they were not at all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by their Presbyteries: but at <hi>Glaſgow</hi> 1610. there was both a materiall and formall election, though not free but pre-limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſe the King and the Biſhops had deſigned the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whom they would have them to ſend; and let it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, whether upon the matter there be not the like and as realll a pre-limitation, by the Act and Letter of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion: In the year 1606. and 1610. the King and the Biſhops nominate who ſhall come and deſign, whom the Presbytery ſhall ſend, without leaving them to chooſe ſuch of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber as they thought fit, and in the year 1651. the Commiſsion deſignes who of their number they ſhall not ſend, to wit, none that were oppoſite to the Publick Reſolutions (for this much their Act wherein they require them to be cited to the Aſſembly doth import, as afterwards ſhall be cleared) not

leaving Presbyteries to their own freedome, chooſe ſuch of their number as they thought fit, and is not the one of there a pre-limitation, and hinders a free choice as wel as the other? Doth not he pre-limite who ſaith that you ſhall not chooſe ſuch men of your number, as well as he who ſaith you ſhall chooſe ſuch men of your number; in the mean while it is to be obſerved, that the Aſſembly 38. hath no ſuch diſtinction as that of active and paſsive ſolicitations, but infers the laſt Preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>juris &amp; de jure</hi> from and upon the firſt, and not without good reaſon, becauſe none doubt of the influence of commands of Superiors, when the deſire is granted, and the direction is followed by the inferior, eſpecially when the effect is contrary to the former cuſtome and practiſe when they were free: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Author hath endeavoured to darken as much as he can the pre-limiting of the elections in Presbyteries, by the Letter and Act of the Commiſsion, by his diſtinction of active and paſſive pre-limitation, therefore upon ſuppoſall that the Letter and Act of the Commiſsion, did contain a pre-limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the elections, which ſhall be afterwards cleared; I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thus: For proving that Presbyteries were paſſively pre-limited in their elections by that Letter and Act; who ſo in their elections accepts of, and yeelds obedience unto a Letter and Act containing a pre-limitation of their elections; are paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively pre-limited in their elections: But the Presbyteries did accept of, and yeeld obedience to ſuch a Letter and Act, <hi>ergo,</hi> &amp;c. The firſt Propoſition is a clear truth, and agreeable to the Authors own words when he is explaining paſſive pre-limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, active ſolicitation of Judges and members of a Judicatory ſaith he, proves not a Judicatory corrupt, unleſſe it can be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced, that they have accepted and yeelded unto the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation. The ſecond Propoſition to wit, That the Presbyteries did accept of, and yeeld obedience unto that Letter and Act, becauſe it was not onely received and read in the moſt part of Presbyteries before their elections, without any teſtimony given againſt it, but alſo appointed to be put upon record in their books in teſtimony of their approving thereof, and as the ground and order of their proceedings in the things contained therein, and obedience was given thereto in moſt places, by forbearing to chooſe any ſuch as appears by the Rolls of the Commiſſioners,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:166443:67"/>
in ſame places ranverſing former elections, and appointing new ones to be made up on that ground, as appears in the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Presbytery of <hi>Dunkell</hi>; in ſome places oppoſing the chooſing of ſuch as were oppoſite to the Publick Reſolutions, and diſſenting from, and Proteſting againſt their being choſen, as in the Elections of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> in ſuch places intimating to ſuch as were chooſing in their abſence, that they might not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them unleſſe they did declare themſelves ſatisfied with the Publick Reſolutions, as in the presbytery of <hi>Mearnes</hi>: for ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying of which, I deſire it to be taken notice of, that that Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery having choſen the Lord <hi>Arburthnet</hi> to be Ruling Elder to the Generall Aſſembly, they did afterwards writ unto him a Letter, and ſent by ſome of their own number, in which Letter are contained theſe words: We have ſent two of our number who will take your Lordſhips Declaration when you accept and give your oath to diſcharge your truſt faithfully, whether your Lordſhip is ſatisfied with the Publick Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but if you have any heſitation and ſcrouple therein (as we hope you have not) we muſt make choice of another, and in ſome places refuſing upon that accompt to ſubſcribe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Commiſsion of theſe who were ſent from Burghes, as in the Presbytery of <hi>Kirkaldie,</hi> who after the reading the ſaid Act and Letter of the Commiſsion, did refuſe to ſubſcribe the Commiſsion given by the Burgh of <hi>Bruntiland</hi> to <hi>Magnus Aitoun.</hi> becauſe he compeared not with the Commiſsion himſelf to declare his minde anent the Publick Reſolutions. Theſe may be inſtances enough to prove their obedience; If it were needfull to take up time in ſo clear a buſineſſe, we could bring ſundry moe which we now delay, becauſe they may be ſubjoyned to the end of this Paper; but to ſay no more of this purpoſe, the Synods and Presbyteries citing of ſuch to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Aſſembly as did oppoſe the Publick Reſolutions by the order of the Letter and Act (which order for citation did by neceſſary conſequence incapacitate them to be Commiſsioners) is an undenyable teſtimony that they accepted of, and yeelded obedience thereunto.</p>

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:166443:68"/>
yet extant in Presbytery Books, but we ſhall content our ſelves to hold near hand; the late Commiſsion did nothing but what the Commiſſion did in the year <hi>48.</hi> wherein the chief Proteſters had a chief hand, and yet maintain the lawfulneſſe of that deed, and the freedome and lawfulneſſe of the conſtitution of that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly that followed thereupon; To this the writer of the large Paper replyeth ſundry things in anſwer to Objection <hi>1.</hi> But nothing to take away the force thereof: Firſt, he hints at two differences between the one and the other, as he would have the reader think he might make uſe of, but paſſeth by, as having to ſay beſide; To ſay nothing (ſaith he) of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of reference and citation, neither yet of the difference of a Letter and Act importing that there is a conſiderable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between theſe things, and that the Commiſsion <hi>48.</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed perſons diſsentient from them onely to be referred, and did ſend a letter onely; whereas, the Commiſsion <hi>50.</hi> made an Act alſo, and appointed Perſons alſo to be cited to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Aſsembly; to which we oppone firſt, the difference between a citation and a reference, when the reference of a perſon to be tryed and judged on a fault, and the perſon is preſent at the reference is juſt nothing, ſee Aſsembly <hi>1643.</hi> Seſſion <hi>2.</hi> Aug. <hi>3.</hi> Overtures anent Bils, &amp;c.

                           </gap>ing not to chooſe any ſuch Commiſsioners to a Generall Aſſembly, this were no undue pre-limitation or prejudging their liberty in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection; I believe that none of the Proteſters will differ from the Author in this: That Presbyteries ought not to chooſe any to be Commiſſioners that teaches doctrine contrary to the word of God, and Conſtitutions of the Kirk agreeable thereto, and if the Commiſſion in their Letter and Act had terminated themſelves within theſe bounds, no Proteſter would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted with them about it, and I think neither will he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovert with them in this, that if a Commiſsion, or any other Kirk Judicatory teach doctrine contrary to the word of God, and to the conſtitution of the Church agreeable thereunto, and write to Presbyteries to chooſe none to be Commiſſioners to the General Aſſembly who doth oppoſe ſuch doctrine, that this is a pre-limiting and prejudging of Presbyteries in the liberty of their elections, according to theſe condeſcentions. The Commiſſion in the 51. having ſent to Presbyteries a Letter and Act before their elections relating thereto; It ſeems unavoidably to follow, that ſome limitation and direction there was in that Letter and Act concerning the elections: But all the queſtion is, whether it was a limitation warrantable or unwarrantable: Now if ſo, why hath the Author ſo cautiouſly, and ſo much
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:166443:69"/>
wraſtled to deny that that letter and Act had any influence upon the elections in Presbyteries; if it was nothing but a neceſſary &amp; lawful warning, putting them in mind of, and ſtirring them up to a duty whereto they were bound, though no ſuch direction had been ſent unto them, then there was no cauſe to be affraid of the looſing of any ground by acknowledging of its influence, the Authors long wrangling about that, doth either ſeem to ſay that he is ſuſpicious of the limitation contained therein, as not being warrantable, or elſe that he hath too great goodwil to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, ſeing this would have been a ſhort and ſatisfying an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. The Commiſſion in their Letter and Act did put no bonds on Presbyteries in the election of Commiſsioners, but ſuch as are well warranted by the word of God, and Acts and Conſtitutions of this Church, and therefore as the one did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their duty in holding forth the ſame, ſo the other did nothing but their duty in accepting thereof, and giving o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience thereto. His long and operous diſputation gives his readers occaſion to think, that he is jealous of ſo open and plain a defence: His next and great refuge is, that the Commiſsion did nothing therein but what other Commiſsions and meetings had done before them in the ſame matter, in relation to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Commiſſioners, which I do confidently deny, for the inſtances which he names in the years 1638. 39. 40. and 41. Becauſe he doth but name them without condeſcending upon any particular, which it is like he would have done, if he had found them much to his purpoſe; I paſſe them with theſe conſiderations, that what was done in 38. was no authoritative direction, but a friendly information and advice, and that not in a Church adhering to Reformation, but in a Church that had made defection therefrom, and what was done 39. 40. and 41. was agreeable to the Word of God, and conſtitutions of the Church: But what was done in the 51. was an authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive direction in a Church now reformed from corruptions, and was contrary to the word of God, and conſtitutions of this Church. As to the inſtance of the Commiſsion 1648. which he makes his great refuge, and the things which he ſaith thereof: Firſt, I do not know who are the chief Proteſters, they are all joyned as yoak-fellows in one and the ſame duty, and I think
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:166443:69"/>
he doth as little know who had a chief hand in that of the 48. but I believe, all of the Proteſters do own it, and maintain both the lawfulneſſe of that deed, and the freedome and lawfulneſſe of the Conſtitution of that Aſſembly, and yet do no ways there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hold themſelves bound to maintain the deed of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion 1651. or the freedom and lawfulneſſe of the Aſſembly of that year, becauſe of the great differences betwixt theſe two deeds, which doth ſtill yet ſtand unreconciled, notwithſtanding all the pains the Author hath taken to make them ſpeak the ſame thing. As to pre-limitation, I ſhall not wrangle with him about the difference of a Reference and a Citation, whether it be conſiderable or not; onely this, the Reference in the 48. was not a Reference of particular concernment, (of which ſort only the Aſſembly 1643. Seſſ. 2. <hi>Aug.</hi> 3. ſpeaks, making it equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to a Citation if the perſon be preſent) or in order to a ſentence upon the perſons, and therefore requires no Citation in caſe of their abſence, but of generall concernment, that the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly might after hearing ſuch of themſelves as did appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, adviſe what courſe to preſcribe to Presbyteries anent them; and if a Reference and a Citation (as he ſtates it) be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, why did the Commiſsion of the 51 require them not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be referred, but alſo to be cited. If he ſay, becauſe they might happen to be abſent from the Presbytery, then either the Commiſsion in the 48 and their Clerk, did not underſtand theſe Legalities, or elſe they meaned not to have them cited, in caſe of their abſence from the Presbytery. As to his deſire to the Writer, I have ſpoken with him concerning his knowledge of the purpoſe of the Commiſsion in the year 1648. when they did deſire Presbyteries to referre ſuch to the Generall Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and he deſires me to return the Author this anſwer, That to the beſt of his knowledge, and ſo far as he doth remember, the Commiſsion had not that purpoſe, that there ſhould be laid on theſe who were referred, an obligation legall, to compeare perſonally before the Generall Aſſembly, for tryall and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon them; and he ſeems to me therein to ſpeak truth: Firſt, becauſe there is no mention in the Act of uſing any Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe who ſhall be abſent from the Presbyteries, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which there could be in that caſe no obligation upon them
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:166443:70"/>
to compear. Secondly, becauſe they lay no legall obligation upon the Presbyteries, either to cite or referre them, but recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends onely to referre them; and I do not ſee how any Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries refuſing what was deſired, could have been ſentenced for diſobedience. I know that when any Judicatory writes a Letter, there is an Act for it, and for the matter of it; but the Author is a litle wide in his Criticks, when he ſayeth, That the Letter it ſelf hath the force of an Act. If he mean it of every Letter from a Judicatory, wherein any thing is recommended or deſired to be done, and of an Act laying on a legall obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but behold (ſayeth the Author) an Act <hi>in terminis,</hi> as it ſtands regiſtrate in the Commiſsion-Books the 5. of <hi>June,</hi> 1648. The Commiſsion of the Generall Aſſembly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends earneſtly to Presbyteries, to take ſpeciall notice of every Brothers carriage in the Publick buſineſſe, that if any be found that do not declare themſelves againſt the preſent Malignant courſe, nor joyn with their Brethren in the common Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof, they be referred to the next Generall Aſſembly; and if any of them have already, declared for it, that they be preſently cenſured, <hi>ſic ſubſcribitur Andrew Ker.</hi> For all the Authors exclamation, here is yet no Act, I mean nothing au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative and importing a legall obligation, but a meer recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation; whio ſo peruſes the Commiſsions Books, will find their Acts by which they mean to lay on legal obligations upon theſe whom they concern, caſten in another mould, they do or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, appoint or require, as is evident from the Letters and Acts from the Commiſsion 51 relating to the oppoſits of the Publick Reſolutions. And albeit the Authors memory hath failed him in a word, in calling it a Letter, yet it hath failed him nothing upon the matter, ſeeing it is clear, that his meaning was, that it was nothing authoritative for laying on a legall obligation; but a Letter, or ſuch a thing as a Letter, that uſually doth onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend or deſire, and therefore this ſo ſmall a miſtake, needs not make any to doubt the more of alleadgeances of this kind afterwards in matters of fact, though haply clear and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall teſtimonies of Regiſters be not brought forth; and if the Author will be content to be weighed in his own ballance, there ſhall upon this ground be juſt occaſion to doubt of many
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:166443:70"/>
things which he ſayeth, becauſe he doth oft-times in matters of fact, aſſert things that never had a being, let be to miſtake the name of a Paper, by calling it a Letter, when it is an Act. From what hath been ſaid, it appeares that there is a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable difference betwixt what was done in the Commiſsion 48, and the Commiſsion 51. In the 48 there is no more but a meer recommendation to referre to the Aſſembly, which doth not lay any legall obligations upon the Presbyteries to do it; nor upon the perſons to compeare incaſe of their abſence from the Presbytery, and not being cited: But in the 51 there is a formal authoritative Act, requiring them to be referred and cited.</p>

                        <p>I Deſire that in making of this compariſon, it may be taken notice of, that the Commiſsion in the year 1651. had long before the ſending of that Letter and Act now upon debate ſent to Presbyteries, not only Publick Warnings, wherein the oppoſits of Publick Reſolutions are characterized as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants, and holden forth upon the matter, as the betrayers of the Cauſe and Countrey, and animating the Civil Magiſtrate to uſe Civill Cenſures againſt them (as ſhall be afterwards proved from the Papers themſelves) but alſo a Letter and Act requiring them to cenſure ſuch, the tenour hereof followeth: Reverend and Welbeloved Brethren, finding that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of our faithfull Warnings and great pains taken to ſatisfie all men to concur in their places for furthering of the Leavies, for defence of Religion, King and Kingdome, and all other our deareſt Intereſts, many are ſo far from concurring, that they do very vehemently go about to obſtruct the Work, by writing, preaching and perſwading to the contrary: We do therefore require you, that you carefully enquire in your Presbyteries, what Miniſters do preach, or otherwiſe perſwade, contrary to our preſent publick and publiſhed Reſolutions; and that you proceed to cenſure ſuch as are in your own number; and if any Miniſter that travels among you, tranſgreſſe in that kind, let him not be permitted to preach in your bonnds; <hi>Sic ſubſcribitur Pearth, March</hi> 20. 1651. It is not then to much purpoſe to tell us, that the Act and Letter of the Commiſsion doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Presbyteries to cenſure any at all for oppoſing of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Reſolutions, ſeeing they had expreſſely done it long before that time in another Letter and Act ſent for that purpoſe; and the ſecond thing wherein he compares them, will alſo be found no wayes conſiderable, if we ſhall remember that theſe Warnings of which we ſpok, hath no diſtinction of ſuch as profeſſe themſelves unſatisfied with Publick Reſolutions, and ſuch as do oppoſe them, but takes in both the one and the other; yea, and theſe who are ſilent too, and applys the Acts of former Generall Aſſemblies againſt them, as is evident from
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:166443:71"/>
the Warning iſſued from <hi>Pearth, March</hi> 20, 1651. I wiſh the Author had told us how he differences ſuch as profeſſe themſelves unſatisfied, and ſuch as oppoſe. Can a man profeſſe himſelf unſatisfied, and even after conference profeſſe himſelf ſo, and yet be ſilent, and ſay nothing to the contrary? I believe he means not oppoſition by force; but a Miniſters declaring his judgment, and bearing teſtimony againſt the courſe in his ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and calling, and how a man ſhould profeſſe himſelf unſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and not to do this, I cannot tell, unleſſe he ſhould become neutrall and indifferent in the matter of his duty. He aſſerts ſundry to have been depoſed in the 48. namely, for ſpeaking ſome few words againſt the Commiſſions Declaration againſt the Engagement, but doth not let his Reader know who theſe were, and by whom and when they were depoſed; I do not remember of any (neither yet do others who were much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about theſe matters) that were depoſed by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for ſpeaking againſt their Declaration againſt the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement before the Aſſembly 1648. and if he mean it after the Aſſembly, it is not to the purpoſe. Which things make it appear, that the Author hath not found the Commiſſion 48 ſo rigide and ſevere, that he hath any cauſe to preferre the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion of the 51 unto them for moderation and ſparingneſſe, though there were no difference upon the matter, and in regard of the perſons with whom they had to do.</p>

                     <p>NOw to the reſt inſiſted on; Firſt, ſaith the Paper in the year <hi>48,</hi> when a little before the election of Commiſsion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to the Generall Aſſembly, it was moved by ſome of the Commiſsion, that ſomething might be written to Presbyteries, requiring them to chooſe none but ſuch as were againſt the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement; it was oppoſed and refuſed by the Commiſsion, as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring a way of pre-limitation of the Aſſembly, and all that was there done was a Letter written to Presbyteries, giving them accompt of their proceedings, and exhorting them to their duty, to chooſe able and faithful men. Anſwer. That more was done in the preceding Generall Aſſembly, we have made it evident.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:166443:72"/>
But what is all this ſaid here to what was alleadged, that the late Commiſsion had done nothing but what the Commiſsion <hi>48</hi> had done before them? Did the Commiſsion 51write to Presbyteries, requiring them not to chooſe any againſt, or oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to their reſolutions, to be Commiſsioners, not one word more or leſſe of this? Or did not the Commiſsions Act <hi>48,</hi> bear and import as much as the Act and Letter of the Commiſsion <hi>51,</hi> yea, as much and more both extenſive and intenſive, as was clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the preceeding. But you will ſay (as it is in the Paper) in the Commiſsion <hi>48,</hi> about that time that a motion was made, that ſomething ſhould be written to require Presbyteries, not to chooſe any but ſuch, &amp;c. and was oppoſed and refuſed, as favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring pre-limittation. Anſwer. I will not ſay who made the motion; but I ſay, this is to little purpoſe; for, what if I ſhall ſay the like motion was made in the Commiſsion <hi>51,</hi> and oppoſed and refuſed too; But further I prove by the Writer of this Paper his grounds what the Commiſsion <hi>48</hi> did upon the matter; that which they did, was really to pre-limitat Presbyteries, that they ſhould chooſe none but ſuch, as if they had written as much to them in formal expreſſe terms; for their Commiſsion required Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries either to refer (or upon the matter to cite) to Generall Aſſemblies, or to cenſure preſently theſe who were otherwiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed without leaving any of them; Firſt now ſuch as were under any cenſure clear, could not be choſen Commiſsioners, &amp; the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter himſelf ſaith in anſwer to the <hi>3</hi> Objection, branch <hi>2,</hi> That it cannot be denyed, that a citation in matter of ſcandal in doctrine or manners, will or ought to exclude a man from being a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsioner. Therefore upon the matter that the Commiſsion did require, that Presbyteries ſhould chooſe none but ſuch as were againſt the Engagement, the Act and Letter of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion <hi>51,</hi> if it did import excluſion of any from being Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsioners, was not ſo wide by far; It required not all unſatisfied, but ſuch as continued to oppoſe to be cited; and there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny unſatisfied at that time, who made no oppoſition, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore might have been, for ought that can be any wayes drawen from the Act and Letter, choſen to be Commiſsioners, as ſundry were <hi>de facto.</hi> Second conſideration preſented in anſwer to the former alleadgeance, is, that that Letter of the Commiſsion <hi>48,</hi>
                        <pb n="107" facs="tcp:166443:72"/>
was not written by the Commiſsion, as we remember, until moſt part, if not all elections in Presbyteries were paſſed, as will be cleared in the date thereof. Anſ. So were many of the elections of Presbyteries paſt before the Letter of the late Commiſsion came to them; but that all, or moſt part of elections were paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Letter was written <hi>48</hi> to Presbyteries, we cannot upon a naked aſsertion believe. The Writer would have done wel here to expreſse the date of the Letter; for I doubt not but he might have had it out of ſome near Presbyterie Book; I cannot give a double of it for the preſent, but I ſhal give an evident preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that it was otherwayes then it is ſaid here. Firſt, in ſome Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries, I will take upon me to prove, that ſome Presbytery, dayes, ere they began to think on the Election of Commiſsioners ſome of their Members were upon that Letter of ſilence in the Publick buſines, referred and cited to the Gen. Aſsembly. Next, look to the date of the Act of that Commiſsion formerly ſet down here, it is upon the <hi>5.</hi> of <hi>June.</hi> Now, it is evident, that this Act hath been made in order to that Letter, if it ſelf was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſent with it, and the Aſsembly did ſit that year upon the <hi>12.</hi> of <hi>July;</hi> ſo that betwixt the appointment of the Letter and the date of it could not be much after it, and the down-ſitting of the Aſsembly, there interveened full five weeks. Now, allowing eight dayes for the diſpatch thereof unto Presbyteries (to the moſt part to what Presbyteries it might ſooner come) it might have been at Presbyteries twenty or twenty five dayes before the Aſsembly. Now, it is well known, that few Presbyteries, except it be ſuch as are fartheſt diſtant, chooſes their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners ſo long before the Aſsembly.</p>

                        <p>THat no more was done in the Commiſsion of the 48, then writing of that Letter which gave the Presbyteries an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of their proceedings &amp;c. is not aſſerted by the Writer; yea, he tells plainly enough, that more was done; for the thing which he ſaith, is, that no more was then done, <hi>h. e.</hi> when that motion was made, and within two or three lines he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns, that that Letter which is mentioned in the objection, was
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:166443:73"/>
not writen by the Commiſsion, until moſt part, if not all the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in Presbyteries were paſt, and therefore the Author does wrong when he leaves out the circumſtance of time, which the writer put in, and expounds him ſo to his reader, as if he had ſaid that there was no more done at any time, neither then nor there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; but he cannot underſtand what all that is ſaid of this is, to that which was alledged that the late Commiſſion had done nothing, but that which the Commiſsion in the 48. had done before them. It is to that which was alledged, becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes for clearing of the Commiſsion of the 48. as to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of pre-limitation, becauſe they did reject all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions tending that way. It is true that the Act and Letter of the 51. did not expreſly, and in the words bear that none who did oppoſe the Publick Reſolutions ſhould be choſen Commiſſioners; but it did by good and clear conſequence import no leſſe, and what ever the Author be pleaſed to ſay of the recommendation that was ſent to Presbyteries in the 48. that it doth contain as much and more then the Letter and Act of the 1651. yet hath he not proven it. The Author tels us, that he will not ſay who made the motion in the Commiſſion in the 48. for writing to Presbyteries to chooſe none but ſuch as were againſt the engagement; And withall, what if he ſhal ſay that the like motion was made in the Commiſsion 51. and oppoſed and refuſed; I believe as he will not ſay ſo, ſo he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay who made the motion, and the men whom haply by ſuch hints he would render ſuſpected, were not the makers, but the oppoſers of it. If the like motion was made and oppoſed in the Commiſsion 51. why did he not ſpeak it out? but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving theſe things to little purpoſe, he falls upon proving by the writers own grounds, that the Commiſsion 48. did upon the matter that that did, as really pre-limitate Presbyteries, that they ſhould chooſe none, but ſuch as did oppoſe the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, as if they had writen as much to them in formall expreſs termes. His proof of this point as he layes it down, may be thus drawen in form: Whoſoever requires Presbyteries ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to refer to the Generall Aſſembly, or to cenſure preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe who are otherwiſe diſpoſed, they do by the writers grounds pre-limitate the Presbyteries in their elections: But
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:166443:73"/>
the Commiſsion of the Generall Aſſembly 1648. did ſo, <hi>ergo, &amp;c.</hi> The firſt Propoſition he makes out thus: Such as were under a clear cenſure could not be choſen Commiſsioners, and the writer himſelf ſaith in anſwer to the third Objection, 2. branch, that it cannot be denyed that a citation in matter of ſcandall, in doctrine or manners will or ought to exclude a man from being a Commiſſioner. I ſhall not in anſwer to this yeeld unto him all that he alledgeth, though it all might be yeelded without any prejudice to the Cauſe; becauſe on ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſall that there had been a limitation in that which was done by the Commiſsion in the 48. it being a limitation agreeable to the Word of God, and conſtitutions of this Church, it was due and warrantable, which the other in the 51. was not; but leaving this to fall in its own place. I return anſwer firſt to the firſt Propoſition, by diſtinguiſhing of the times when ſuch a thing is done, whoſoever before or in the time of elections requires this thing, it is true of them that they do pre-limite elections; but who ſo requires not this til the elections be firſt made; it is not true of theſe, and this was the caſe in the year 48. the elections being paſt in moſt places before it was done, and might be juſtly preſumed to have been paſt in all, as ſhall afterwards be more fully cleared; but it was not ſo in the 51. what was then done, being previous to the elections. Next, I give clear anſwer by denying the minor, becauſe the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion did not require ſuch a thing, the moſt that they did was to recommend it, which is far from requiring, and therefore by the writers grounds the Author hath proven nothing at all. To the ſecond conſideration, that the Letter and Act of the Commiſsion 48. was not writen untill moſt part, or all electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Presbyteries was paſt, he makes anſwer that ſo were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the elections of Presbyteries before the Letter and Act of the Commiſsion 51. came unto them: But that is not true, if we take the Authors own ground, to wit, that few Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, except it be ſuch as are fartheſt diſtant chooſeth their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsioners 20. or 25. dayes before the Aſſembly, and allowing 8. dayes for diſpatch to Presbyteries, and take withall the date of the Letter and Act of the Commiſsion 1651. which is the 28. day of <hi>May,</hi> and compare it with the day of the down ſitting
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:166443:74"/>
of the Aſſembly, which was the 16. day of <hi>July,</hi> the untruth of this will appear, becauſe between the date of the Act, and the diet of the Aſſembly are 48. dayes, of which deducing 8. for the diſpatch, there do remain 40. dayes till the Aſſembly, which do far exceed the time ſpoken of by the Author, for the other part of it, that moſt part of the elections 48. were paſt before the Letter and Act of the Commiſsion came unto them; I do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Presbytery Books. There is little or no weight in the preſumptions that the Author gives to the contrary. 1. He takes upon him to prove, that ſome Presbyteries did upon that Letter and Act refer and cite ſome of their members to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Aſſembly, ſome Presbytery dayes before they began to think upon the election of Commiſſioners but he hath named none, and compriſes them under the word ſome, haply leſt it ſhould be known how few there were, probably but one, that is, <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> in the matter of one of their univerſity men, who was alſo a Miniſter. Next he makes a ſupputation but of 8. dayes for the diſpatch of the Letter to Presbyteries, and that to the moſt part of Presbyteries, it might have ſoon come, and but of 20. or 25. dayes interveening betwixt the diet of the Aſſembly and the elections in moſt parts of Presbyteries; If the cuſtome of diſpatch had been by paſts hired, and diſpatched to ſeverall parts immediatly, after the writing of the Letter, and making of the Act, it might have come to the moſt part of Presbyteries in 8. dayes, but ſo it was not, neither in the 48. nor 51. but by occaſionall bearers, and therefore would take more time, and I think it is ſaid <hi>gratis,</hi> that few Presbyteries do make their elections 20. or 25. dayes before the Aſſembly; but there is no ſure way of determining theſe differences about cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of time, when neither the one nor the other Letter came to Presbyteries, but from the Presbytery books, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to theſe I do appeal to ſtand or fal in this matter, at their ſentence, only remembering this, that it is clear that the date of the Letter and Act of the Commiſsion 48. is but five weeks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Aſſembly, whereas the date of the other is 7. weeks before the Aſſembly.</p>

                     <p>THe third Conſideration preſented by the writer of this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, is, that before the writing of that Letter (by the Commiſsion <hi>48.</hi>) the whole Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> almoſt in all the Presbyteries and Synods thereof had declared themſelvs in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience unſatisfied with the engagement, excepting a very few Miniſters ſcattered here and there in Presbyteries, which few were alſo known to be oppoſites to the work of God, or neutralls and indifferent therein from the beginning. Anſwer <hi>1.</hi> If by the Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> be here underſtood, the collective Kirk, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee how it is true that is ſaid here, that the whole Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> for the moſt part, except a few Miniſters had declared themſelves unſatisfied with the engagement; certain it is, and too certain, that very many in the Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> in this ſenſe of all ranks, in all quarters almoſt, were too evidently too active for it, as the cenſure civill and Eccleſiaſticall which thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on followed do witneſſe; if the Miniſteriall Kirk be underſtood, it is true that the far greater part were diſ-ſatisfied, but yet they were not ſo few Miniſters that were of a contrary minde, they were too many, and in ſome places the greater part of whole Presbyteries. It may well be remembred what a ſumme they were like to have accompted to, at the time of the Generall Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, and it ſeems to me too much, that all of them were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther oppoſers of the work (whether hereby be underſtood the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward work of Reformation, or the power of Religion) or neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trals, or indifferent from the beginning, the contrary is known of ſome of them; and I would not ſay ſo much of all them that were cenſured, though I acknowledge their cenſure was juſt. <hi>2.</hi> A great part of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> before the writing of the late Commiſsions Letter, had declared themſelves ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the Commiſsions Reſolutions, and diſſatisfied with the courſe of the oppoſers thereof; and count when the writer will, he ſhall find that the diſſenters from the Commiſsion 48. were not fewer; yea, not ſo few as the diſſenters from the Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>51.</hi> we know that the number of theſe amounted to at their greateſt Meeting, at <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

                        <p>I Think the Author did well enough know, that in ſetting down of the third Difference, the Writer did not mean of the Collective, but of the Miniſteriall Church, of which not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the greater part, but almoſt all had declared themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied in Conſcience with the Engagement, excepting a few Miniſters ſcattered here and there in Presbyteries, who were known either to be oppoſers of the Work of God, or neutrall and indifferent therein from the beginning; it is true, they were too many in regard of the evill courſe they were engaged into; yet were they but few in number who did not at that time in ſome outward way, at leaſt, give ſome teſtimony againſt that Engagement, though (alas) ſome of theſe in theſe late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, have now diſſembled it in their words, and moe have betrayed it in their actions, that what they then did in condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Engagement, and afterwards approving the ſolemn Publick Confeſsion of ſins, and engagement to duties, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their hearts; when the Author hath ſtreatched their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to the utmoſt, the moſt he dare ſay of it, is the great part of whole Presbyteries in ſome places; But theſe ſome places that he ſpeaks of were ſo few, that it will be found they will come to a very poor accompt when they ſhall be named, they were ſo far from being like to amount to any number at the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Aſſembly. If he mean of theſe who were Members of the Aſſembly, that there were few (if any at all) who did not joyn in approving the Declaration of the Aſſembly againſt the Engagement: If he mean of theſe who ſubſcribed the diviſive
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:166443:75"/>
Supplication, theſe were ſo few, that they did not all of them being put together, amount to the twentieth part of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſundry even of theſe, did before the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, joyn with their Presbyteries and Synods, in bearing te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony againſt the Engagement; I will not blame him for his charity to ſome of theſe men: The Writer did not ſay, that all of them were known to be oppoſers, or neutrall, or indifferent in the Work of God from the beginning, but ſpoke indefinitly, meaning (as I take it) of the bulk and generality of them; and I believe the Author himſelf being judge, but few inſtances to the contrary can be given; It is true that a great part of the Church of Scotland before the writing of the late Commiſsions Letter, had declared themſelves ſatisfied with the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Reſolutions, and diſſatisfied with the courſe of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers thereof: But it is alſo true that there was a great part of the Church of Scotland, who had not declared themſelves ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with theſe Reſolutions; yea, a great part who had declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves diſ-ſatisfied therewith; and it is a wonder to me that the Author ſhould ſay, that count when the Writer will, he ſhall find that the diſſenters from the Commiſsion 1648. were not fewer; yea, not ſo few as diſſenters from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion 1651. I hope he is ſpeaking of the Miniſteriall Church in regard of both, the queſtion now being of pre-limiting the elections, and it being to no purpoſe to ſpeak of any other, in regard of theſe; let him name if he can, any Synod, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, or Kirk-Seſsion in <hi>Scotland</hi> that did give any teſtimony or evidence of their diſſent from the proceedings of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion againſt the engagement 1648. If he will believe the teſtimony of the Generall Aſſembly 1650. the whole Miniſtery and body of the People in the Land did joyn in their Prayers and Supplications in private and in Publick againſt the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Miniſters every where in their Sermons did bear clear teſtimony againſt it, and all the Church Judicatories, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, Presbyteries and Seſsions did petition the Parliament a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, and another declaration of the ſame Aſſembly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few dayes thereafter, in anſwer to a paſſage of the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Engliſh Army, tels him ſomewhat to the ſame purpoſe; we do not remember, ſay they, that any of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters

did preach and cry up a war againſt <hi>England,</hi> and as we know that the body of the Miniſtery were unanimous, and zealous in bearing a joynt teſtimony, both in their Sermons and otherwiſe, againſt that war, ſo theſe few that were ſilent have been cenſured for their ſilence; and the Committee of Eſtates at the ſame time in their Declaration teſtifie thus: Did not all the Judicatories of the Kirk unanimouſly oppoſe and declare againſt it? Did not the Miniſters faithfully Preach and Pray againſt it, and generally all that feared God in the Land Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition againſt it, and many ſuch Paſſages are to be found in our Publick Papers, from the time of carrying on the engagement; yet the Author is ſo zealous to weaken every thing, that the writer ſaith, for differencing that which was done by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion 1648. and the Commiſsion 1651. that he had rather retrench upon that which hath been often and truly declared by this Church of their being free of any acceſſion to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull engagement then not to do it; this deſerves his ſecond thoughts; but upon the other hand, beſide the generality of theſe in the land who are of known approven godlineſſe and piety, and are diſ-ſatisfied with the Publick Reſolutions, as will, I truſt, be acknowledged by godly men of a contrary mind, ſpeaking ſoberly, and without the heat of diſpute: It is eaſie to give him ſome inſtances of ſome Synods, and of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Prerbyteries, beſides many particular members in Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries throughout all the corners of the Counrry, who were not onely ſilent in ſpeaking for the Publick Reſolutions, but who did bear teſtimony and ſpeak openly againſt them: A thing ſo wel known that I need not ſtay to name the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, but they muſt ſtil be few in his catologue; we know ſaith he what the number of theſe amounted to at their greateſt Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> of late; If he mean that all the Miniſters of the Land who are of that judgement were at that Meeting, he is much miſtaken, and if not ſo, it is not much to the purpoſe, there are many Miniſters in the Land of that judgement, who were not at that Meeting, and yet there were very near a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Miniſters at that Meeting who are approven in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of the godly throughout the Land. He acknowledges that many more of theſe then of the firſt were godly men, and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:166443:76"/>
had been faithfull formerly, but their preſent courſe at that time being not faithfulnes to the Cauſe, but prejudicial to it, and the whole Kirk and Countrey as he thinks, they might juſtly be referred and called before the Aſſembly as wel as the other. It is well that they were godly, and ſuch as had been formerly faithfull; as for their unfaithfulneſſe at that time, it is the point in queſtion betwixt them and the Authors and abbettots of the Publick Reſolutions, they are perſwaded in their Conſciences and have clearly holden forth the ſame unto others, that they were keeping the ground on which the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> did run theſe many years paſt, for defending the Country and Cauſe againſt the enemies thereof; and if others did forſake their ground, they were not to be eſteemed unfaithfull, nor to be charged with that crime, becauſe they would not leave their Maſters Colours; I ſhal not inſiſt upon what he ſpeaks of the tender dealing which they met with, becauſe there may be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to ſpeak to this afterwards, what is apparent in the Letter and Act of the Commiſsion is already ſpoken unto.</p>

                     <p>THe fourth conſideration proponed by the Writer, is, that the Reſolutions then (<hi>viz. 48</hi>) were agreeable to the Covenant, Acts and Conſtitution of former Generall Aſſemblies, whereas the Reſolutions of the late Commiſſion were point blank contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Covenant, and the former Acts and Conſtitutions of this Kirk. Anſwer, this is the onely materiall difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Acts taken, to wit, from the matter that the Commiſsions Reſolutions <hi>48.</hi> were right, but the other <hi>51.</hi> wrong, and upon this alleadgance, that the Reſolutions of the late Commiſsion were contrary to the Covenant and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this Kirk hangeth the ſtrength of the moſt part of the reſt of the arguments, brought to prove the unlawfulneſſe of the late Aſſembly; I will not challenge the Writer that alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the errour if theſe Reſolutions, he ſo often mentions, onely the Covenant, and Acts and Conſtitutions of Aſſemblies, and ſeldome the Word of God or Scripture: For my part in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the truth or errour of an opinion, in mattrrs of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or of the ſinfulneſs or lawfulneſs of a courſe, I would not

                        <p>I Shall not contend whether the difference taken from the matter, be the onely materiall difference, it is certainly the mainly materiall difference, though the other differences of the time, and of Presbyteries &amp; Synods, having declared themſelvs, and that taken from the nature of the thing be alſo important. It is true, that much of the ſtrength of ſeverall other of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hangs on this Alleadgeance, that the Reſolutions of the late Commiſſion, were contrary to the Covenant and Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this Church, and (I hope) that this Aleadgeance will bear the ſtrength of all the Arguments that are founded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon. Theſe worthy Aſſemblies 1638, &amp; 1639, joyned the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with the form in the reaſons brought for nullifying of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer unlawfull Aſſemblies. Before the Author gives anſwer to the difference, he taxeth the Writer, that alleadging the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of theſe Reſolutions, he ſo often mentions onely the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, Acts and Conſtitutions of the Aſſemblies, but ſeldome the Word of God or Scripture, and tells us for his part in ſpeaking of the truth or error of an opinion in matters of Conſcience, he would not mention <hi>regulatas ſine regula regulante.</hi> Well, it ſeems ſome of the Proteſters (if the Writer of this Paper be of that number) hath reſpect enough to the Acts and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the Aſſembly; for the want of which, the Author challenged one of them not long ago, as ſaying, that he was not
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:166443:77"/>
to be preſſed with them in matters of Conſcience; and it alſo ſeems that in matters of Conſcience, the Author likes not the maintaining, much leſſe the preſſing of theſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Word of God; and ſome will perhaps think<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that a man of that mind might bear with his brother, ſaying, Preſſe me not with humane Conſtitutions in matters of Conſcience; <hi>ſed multum intereſt quid loquatur.</hi> The reaſon why the Writer doth often mention only the Covenant, Acts and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of Aſſemblies, is, becauſe when we ſpeak of a defection in reſolutions and actings from former Principles, it is the more near and convincing way to mention the former Acts and Conſtitutions of that Church, which immediatly muſt decide whether a delegated Commiſſion, which is only intruſted to execute former Acts, and hath no power to make new ones, hath walked according to their truſt, yea, or not: and a ſecond Reaſon is, becauſe the Writer took it for uncontroverted, as being acknowledged by all the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and Acts and Conſtitutions of this Church, did preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and include the firſt and ſupreme rule, the <hi>Word of God</hi>; And the Author cannot but know, that though the Writer had not mentioned the Word of God further then it is included in the Covenant, and Acts and Conſtitutions of the Church, he hath great Patrons for his ſo doing, to wit, the Aſſembly at <hi>Glaſgow</hi> 1638. which in their great Acts againſt Epiſcopacy, Five Articles of <hi>Pearth,</hi> Service Book, &amp;c. do ſtate, vote and print the Queſtions anent them, meerly upon their contrariety to the Nationall Covenant, and Acts and Conſtitutions of this Church, without mentioning <hi>Regulam Regulantem,</hi> that being preſuppoſed by all as being included in <hi>Regula regulata.</hi> But to the point.

and reſume theſe things, I ſhall onely ask the Author a very few plain Queſtions, and deſire a down-tight and plain Anſwer to them in order to this point: Firſt, whether in the judgment of many of theſe who were by the Publick Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of the Commiſſion, 1651. admitted to truſt in the Army and State, the Solemn League and Covenant, and former Acts and Conſtitutions of this Church, were not oppoſite to theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions. Secondly, whether in the judgment of many of the godly in the Land, theſe Reſolutions and proceedings were not oppoſite to the Solemn League and Covenant, and the former Acts and Conſtitutions of this Church, and could not be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled therewith? Thirdly, whether it was not thought and ſpoken by no mean men, Members of the Commiſsion 1651, and others who carried on the Publick Reſolutions, that theſe who had hand in the penning of the Publick Papers of the Kirk theſe years paſt, had in reference to the matter then in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate foiſted in many ſentences and expreſsions in theſe Papers contrary to the true intent and meaning of the Judicatories of the Church, which they then made uſe of for their own ends. 4. whether the ſin of imploying many Malignant &amp; diſ-affected men in our Armies, which is confeſt in the ſolemn Publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion of ſins, be not comprehenſive of imploying of ſuch in our defenſive war againſt <hi>James Grahame.</hi> Fifthly, whether the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Engagement in the 48, do not bind us to avoid all the ſins that we acknowledged in the Solemn Confeſsion, and all the ſnares and temptations that led thereunto, and to endeavour all the contrary duties? Sixthly, whether the Generall Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and their Commiſsion, after the coming of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to invade this Land, did not poſitively, and oftener then once, determine and warn againſt the imploying and intruſting Malignant and diſ-affected men in our Armies, even in the caſe of ſcarcity of men for the Lands defence? Seventhly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the time of the Commiſsion its giving their anſwer to the Parliaments Quere, there was not a very numerous Party of Malignant and diſ-affected men in the Land, who did adhere to their former principles? Eighthly, whether the Anſwer to the Quere, or any thing contained in the Publick Reſolutions do acknowledge it, or hold it forth as ſinfull and unlawfull to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:166443:78"/>
imploy and intruſt Malignant and diſ-affected men in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Cauſe and Kingdome? Or whether that Anſwer and theſe Reſolutions, do acknowledge and hold it forth to be lawfull to imploy and intruſt ſuch? Ninthly, whether there be any Act, or Conſtitution, or Warning, or Declaration of this Church, or any Publick Evidence of her judgment before the Anſwer to the Quere, that ſpeaks for the warranting and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Publick Reſolutions? or what it is, or where we may finde it? Tenthly, that the Commiſsioners are yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to have their late Reſolutions tryed and judged by the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> is no great matter, when they have firſt pre-limited an Aſſembly, excluding many of theſe who were of a contrary mind, and conſtituting it moſtly of theſe who are of their own judgment, and have made Acts for cenſuring of all who ſhall not acknowledge the Conſtitution of that Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and after conference, ſubmit to the obedience of theſe Acts; but if the Author would take the collective Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> to ſit as Judges upon the late Reſolutions of the Commiſsion; and ſtate the queſtion thus, whether are the late Reſolutions of the Commiſsion, agreeable to the Solemn League and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and to former Acts, Conſtitutions, Warnings and Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this Church, I fear the determination ſhould be in the negative; ye<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:166443:79"/>
and the Proteſtation againſt the ſame; for the reſolutions and proceedings of the Commiſsion <hi>48.</hi> were no leſſe quarrelled by an oppoſit Party, then were the reſolutions of the Commiſsion <hi>51.</hi> the Party quarrelling <hi>48,</hi> being no leſſe then the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in this onely few Miniſters, and the reaſons of the former were a great deal ſtronger and harder to be looſed; the Generall Aſſembly was here Judge to both, as in the firſt quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, the Commiſsion would not be abſolved from the accuſation charged upon them untill all was heard and tryed, ſo the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion <hi>51,</hi> could not be condemned for the exceptions and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadgeances of a few Brethren, before that any of them were or could be cognoſced upon. By all this which hath been ſpoken, that what the Writer ſaith, ſhutting up the ſame, that theſe things being put together, make up a wide difference between that which was then done <hi>48,</hi> and that <hi>51</hi> was but a groundleſſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion; we have evidently ſhowen that there is no difference betwixt the one deed and the other (ſo that if the one was guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of pre-limitation of election of Commiſsioners, ſo was the other no leſs) except that the deed of the Commiſsion <hi>51,</hi> was a great deal more ſparing and moderate. So we have vindicated that particular anſwer to the firſt reaſon againſt the freedome and lawfulneſs of the late Aſsembly, alleadging pre-limitation of the election of Commiſsioners, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Commiſsion did nothing therein but what was done by the Commiſsion <hi>48,</hi> whoſe deed the Proteſters maintains with us.</p>

                        <p>IT is eaſie to give ſundry materiall differences: 1. Theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions at the time of the Conſtitution of the Aſſembly, and the giving in of the Proteſtation; beſides that, they were againſt the clear Letter of Acts of former Aſſemblies. So were ſundry ſtanding up in the Aſſembly, and offering inſtantly to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie that it was ſo; but in the 48, the proceedings were agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Acts of the Aſſembly; and albeit there were ſome who deſired that theſe proceedings might not be approven till they were heard; yet none did offer inſtantly, or at all to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie, thathey had carryed on a courſe of defection, contrary to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:166443:79"/>
the Covenant, and Acts and Conſtitutions of the Church. Secondly, in the 48, the proceedings of the Commiſſion were not teſtified againſt, by Presbyteries and Synods, much leſſe diſſented from, and proteſted againſt by many in the Commiſsion it ſelf: but ſo it was in the 51, not onely did Presbyteries and Synods bear teſtimony againſt theſe things, but a great part of the Commiſſion; yea, ſo great a part, that whoſo ſhall reckon, I believe, ſhall find them very near, if not equall the one half of the number, to whom the truſt of theſe things were committed by the Generall Aſſembly. Thirdly, in the 48, there was no exception at all proponed from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freedome of Elections, or from perſons under ſcandall, becauſe of defection and back-ſliding from former principles; but ſo it was in the 51. Theſe things evidence a very great difference between the one and the other at the time of the Conſtitution of the Aſſembly, &amp; the Proteſtation againſt the ſame, and to take off any thing that the Author ſaith, for proving them to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, I do deſire it further to be conſidered, That as in the 48, it was not the Parliament who was the party quarrelling the Commiſsion before the Aſſembly, the Parliament being riſen a good while before the Aſſembly ſate down: So, in all this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines of the quarrelling that was made againſt the Commiſsion in the Aſſembly 48, is much miſ-taken and miſ-repreſened by the Author all alongs his Vindication, as ſhall in its proper place be cleared. Secondly, that it was not deſired (as the Author doth inſinuate) that the Commiſsion 51, ſhould be condemned for the exceptions and alleadgeances of a few bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren before that any of theſe Reſolutions were or could be cognoſced upon, but onely that they ſhould not be admitted to ſit as Members of the Aſſembly, untill the exceptions propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt them were tryed and diſcuſſed. Thirdly, that in the 48, as the party quarrelling did not either at the time of the Conſtitution of the Aſſembly, or afterwards before the trying and approving of the Proceedings of the Commision, offer any reaſons to the Aſſembly againſt theſe Proceedings; ſo the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which they did afterwards offer, were not very ſtrong nor hard to be looſed, much leſſe ſtronger and harder to be looſed, then the reaſons offered in the 51, by theſe Miniſters, the laſt
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:166443:80"/>
being founded upon the Word of God and the Covenant, and the clear Acts and Conſtitutions of this Church, and the other not ſo; Theſe things being thus diſcuſſed, it ſtill appears that the Writer had good reaſon to ſay, that there is a wide diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt that which was done by the Commiſsion 1648, and that which was done by the Commiſsion 1651. as to the pre-limiting of the Aſſembly, and that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters have reaſon to condemne the laſt, though they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the firſt.</p>

                     <p>WE ſhall adde ſome further conſiderations in anſwer to the firſt Reaſon; But ere we proceed, a word upon what the Writer of the <hi>2.</hi> Paper hath upon the <hi>2.</hi> Objection, which either he hath formed to himſelf, or found I know not where, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was in the Commiſsions power, not onely to appoint theſe who oppoſed the Publick Reſolutions to be cited to the Generall Aſſembly, but alſo to have cenſured them by vertue of a clauſe contained in the Commiſsion; and that therefore having keeped themſelves far within the bounds of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, &amp;c. The Writer of this Paper for clearing of this buſineſs, runs out in a diſcourſe concerning the nature of delegated Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories, that they are and muſt be from the light of nature and common reaſon, limited to a certain rule in all their admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations, to wit, to ſtanding Lawes of the Incorporations to which they do belong, and to a certain end, <hi>viz.</hi> the good and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the whole body, and in application unto, or accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the late Commiſsioners of the Generall Aſſembly their Reſolutions: He affirms, they were not onely without the warrant of an Act of the Aſſembly (which ſhould have been their rule) and not only not contributive for the preſerving and advancing of the Work of Reformation, but expreſly contrary to the clear letter of the Covenant, and multitudes of Acts, and deſtructive to the Work; and that therefore aſſuming to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a power to cenſure or cite ſuch as did oppoſe them; they did not onely go beyond the bounds of their Commiſsion, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the very end of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the preſervation of the Liberties of the Kirk, in bringing Generall Aſſemblies to bondage, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:166443:80"/>
all ſuch as would not conſent to the courſe of defection, a dangerous and damnable preparative, laying a foundation for the totall over-throw of Diſcipline, yea of Doctrine and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; yea, the Commiſsion being once corrupted, the introducing of Prelacie, Service-Book, Popes ſupremacy, the whole body of Poperie. Here certainly, the Writer hath filled his Pen <hi>nigrae ſucco fuliginis,</hi> to render the Commiſsioners odious and deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to all. But to theſe briefly: Firſt, if it was another man that proponed the Objection then the Writer himſelf. I verily think, he did not mean that the Commiſsioners had power by their Commiſsion to cite and cenſure oppoſers of any Reſolutions made by themſelves, right or wrong (neither doth the Objection as ſet down by the Writer himſelf import any ſuch thing) but oppoſers only of their juſt and right reſolutions, ſuch as (I doubt not) he took the late reſolutions to be, and therefore all the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters running out upon the nature of a delegated Judicatory, &amp;c. as to that Objection, is but a fighting againſt his own ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. Secondly, we know and acknowledge, that delegated Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories are limited to a certain end, and a certain rule; yea, we think further, that Judicatories not delegated, but having power originally in themſelves humane are ſo limited too. But that the late Commiſsioners did in their Reſolutions carry on a courſe of defection, contrary to the expreſs letter of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and multitude of Acts of this Kirk, and deſtructive to the Work of Reformation, and that they deſtroyed the Liberties of the Kirk, brought the Generall Aſsembly to bondage, is ſaid, but was never, nor will never be proven; and ſo but a foul ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnie and falſe accuſation of the Brethren, of which that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable expreſsion, calling what the Commiſsioners did, damnable, (which being uſed for aggravation here, cannot ſimply mean onely, that the thing done was worthy to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, as every errour even the leaſt is but alſo damnable to the doers) I pray the Lord give the Writer repentance and forgiveneſs.</p>

                        <p>TO all this I return, That albeit the maker of the Obejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning the Commiſſions power took their Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions to be right and juſt, yet doth not the Writer fight with his own ſhadow, becauſe the objector and the Commiſſion both in the matter of theſe Publick Reſolutions takes wrong for right, and unjuſt for juſt, and upon this miſtake conceives them to have power where they have none, which miſtake the Author diſcovers by holding forth the diſcordance of theſe Reſolutions, with the rule according to which they were bound to proceed, both upon the matter, and by vertue of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion which the Author is pleaſed to call a foul calumny, and uncharitable accuſation of the Brethren, that never was, nor never ſhall be able to be proven: But I deſire him ſoberly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member 1. That neither he, nor any of his judgement to this day have ſo far befriended their own cauſe, or ſatisfied theſe who ſtumble and gainſay, as to bring forth any Act of this Church prior to theſe Reſolutions for juſtifying thereof, though it often hath been called for. 2. That many Acts of this Church hath been brought forth, ſpeaking plainly againſt theſe Reſolutions, to which all the anſwers which hath been retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned may (as I take it) be comprehended in one of theſe two, Either denying that the Malignant party were joyned with, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the defence of which denyall the Author and others may exerciſe their ingines, but ſhall never be able to ſatisfie the conſciences of the godly in it, and I fear nor their own fully; or elſe in telling us that it was a new caſe, which we never before had to do with, or occaſion to detemine, to wit, the caſe of the defence of Cauſe and Kingdom againſt a forrain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion; but it hath been often told him and others (and I wiſh they would once conſider of it) that even in the caſe of the Cauſe and Kingdomes defence againſt forrain invaſion, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſſe in joyning with the Malignant party; hath been often determined by this Church; yea, in that very caſe which is the preſent queſtion, and in the higheſt advantage they can have in the ſtateing of it, that is the caſe of ſcarceneſſe of men

as to his great exception againſt the word <hi>damnable</hi>; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think that the Writer meant it of bringing with it damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Writer; he cannot be ſo groſſe as to take it for the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt; yea, he will, I believe, allow as much in the matter of Salvation to ſome of theſe as to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and deſires to think charitably of all men; I dare ſay, all his meaning was, that it was a thing worthy to be condemned but ſo (ſaith the Author) is every errour, even the leaſt; and I would aske him, is not every errour even the leaſt dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, both in it ſelf, and if mercy prevent not, alſo to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, though ſome be more damnable then others: If I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand any thing of common language, the meaning of that phraſe, a <hi>damnable preparative</hi> is ordinarily this, it is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative worthy to be condemned; and I think the Writer might think himſelf in no ill condition, if he had no more to repent of then the calling of that practice of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſuch.</p>

Act ſpeaks indefinitely of all who after Conference remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied, and continue to oppoſe, how then can he reſtrict it to two ſorts of oppoſers onely, when there may be, and I know are ſeverall other ſorts. 2. Taking the Act as he expounds it, it doth at leaſt as to theſe include a pre-limitation, by exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in the elections, and theſe might have been many, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there were very few who did once profeſſe diſſatisfaction with the Publick Reſolutions, that by Conferences, or other means then uſed by Presbyteries, and Synods, came to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied; yea, there were not a few; who before the elections were conferred with, and yet did ſtill continue to oppoſe. 3. I deſire that it may be marked, That the Author grants that there were many in the Land who were unſatisfied in their judgements with the Publick Reſolutions, beſide theſe who did oppoſe and Act againſt the execution of them; by which <hi>many,</hi> he muſt mean many members of Presbyteries, and ſuch as were in a capacity to be elected Commiſſioners to the Generall Aſſembly, otherwiſe it were not to the purpoſe; it is after wards cleared by himſelf, when he ſaith ſundry ſuch Miniſters were choſen Commiſſioners, and ſate and voted in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; and if there were many unſatisfied with the Publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, who did abſtain from oppoſing (as he himſelf after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) and many who did oppoſe, by teſtifying Publickly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, as (we have proven) it ſeems that the number who did approve of them were not ſo great, and that Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries and Synods were not ſo harmonious about them as is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten given out. 4. That there is not ſo much as probability, let be good evidence for that which the Author aſſerts, that the main end of the Commiſſions Act and Letter ſent to Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, was meer tenderneſſe to keep Presbyteries from cenſuring of ſome who had been too buſie ſticklers againſt Church and State: I give theſe probable evidences to the contrary: 1. Theſe too buſie ſticklers againſt Church and State, by the Authors ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, were very few, and in very few Presbyteries, but that Letter and Act was ſent to all the Presbyteries in the Land, if it be true which the Author ſaid before, that at that time there were four parts of five of Presbyteries that had no oppoſite to the Publick reſolutions, there was no hazard of untender dealing
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:166443:83"/>
there againſt too buſie ſticklers, nor could that be the ſcope and end that the Commiſſion did propone to themſelvs, in ſending their Letter and Act to theſe. 2. Albeit I know that there were ſome in the Commiſſion who did tenderly affect the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of Publick Reſolutions, and did ſtudy to keep ſtroaks off them, yet to make it appear that the plurality in their actings towards theſe who were unſatisfied with, and did oppoſe the Publick Reſolutions were not led with any ſuch tender ſpirit, as the Author here and elſewhere hints; I ſhal ſet down ſome Acts and orders of the Commiſsion which are hinted at by the Author himſelf, under the name of ſome prior Papers: 1. In a Letter written from <hi>Perth, Jan.</hi> 16. 1651.

Reverend, and welbeloved Brethren, finding that notwithſtanding of our
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:166443:83"/>
faithfull Warnings, and great pains taken to ſatisfie all men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in their places, for furthering of the Leavies, for defence of Religion, King and Kingdom, and all other our deareſt Intereſts: many are ſo far from concurring, that they do very vehemently go about by Preaching, Writing, and perſwading to the contrary to obſtruct the Work; we do therefore require you, that you care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully enquire in your Presbyteries what Miniſters doth Preach, or otherwiſe perſwade, contrary to our preſent Publick and publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Reſolutions, and that you proceed to cenſure ſuch as are in your own number, and if any Miniſters that travell among you, tranſgreſſe in that kind, let them not be permitted to Preach in your bounds; here is no great tenderneſſe, that would not ſpare ſo much as theſe gracious Miniſters of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who were driven from their ſtations, and forced to retire to this Land, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faithfull men among our ſelves, who were alſo neceſſitate to retire from their charges at that time; theſe were the travellers who could not be permitted to Preach, ſundry of them being then Preaching in vacant Congregations in the Weſt, and ſome in <hi>Fife,</hi> neither was the Commiſsion ſatisfied with theſe things, but did alſo ſtir up the Civill Magiſtrate againſt them, as afterwards ſhall be made to appear from their own Warning and Remonſtances. 3. conſider the thing in it ſelf; is it tender dealing to be taken out of the hands of a Presbytery, and to be brought before the higheſt and moſt publick Judicatory of the Church; the Apoſtle layes weight upon being reboked by many. Next, as the Author tells us that the end of the Commiſsions Act and Letter, was tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to ſome men, ſo alſo he tels us that there was not one word more or leſſe in them for pre-limiting the elections: But what though the words be in them, yet if they do infer the thing by good and neceſſary conſequence, is not the matter there? It is not much to the purpoſe, that ſundry unſatisfied with the Publick Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons who were not within the compaſſe of that order for citation, and alſo ſome who were conſtant continuing oppoſers, were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Commiſſioners to the Aſſembly, becauſe ſome ſuch were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen in Presbyteries, which were wholly oppoſite to the Publick Reſolutions, and ſome in Presbyteries where the greater part were oppoſite, yet not without diſſents or Proteſtations, or double e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections. The Author doth not well to ſay, that no mans Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:166443:84"/>
was excepted againſt, becauſe of the Publick Reſolutions; I told him before that the Commiſſion of the Presbytery of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kell</hi> was excepted againſt upon that accompt, and that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the firſt election in <hi>Glaſgow</hi> was not onely upon that accompt excepted againſt; but after long and ſerious debate untill the Commiſſions Proceedings ſhould be firſt tryed, which not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuteth what the Author ſaith, but doth alſo prove another thing, which all along he ſeems to deny, to wit, that the Letter and Act of the Commiſsion concerning citation, did import theſe mens being excluded from being Commiſsioners to the Aſſembly, otherwiſe let them render a reaſon, why the objecting againſt them, upon the Letter and Act to cite them, ſhould have enforc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the laying of them aſide, untill the Commiſsions Proceedings ſhould be firſt tryed, if the Aſſembly had taken it for granted, that it did not import this, they could not have admitted this as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to exclude them for an houre; That ſundry moſt eminent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers were admitted to be members without any quarrelling, and to be Moderators and Clerks of Committees, the Writer gave the reaſon of it to be Policy, and I ſhal take in conſideration in its own place what the Author anſwereth thereunto: But ſuppoſe all this to be true, will this make a free Aſſembly, or Vindicate the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from pre-limitation? The pre-limitation which is now in queſtion is, that of the elections in Presbyteries, which would ſtil have been a pre-limitation of the Aſſembly, as to its conſtituent members, though the Aſſembly had condemned it, much more was it ſo when they did approve and allow of it; but of the ground of this miſtake I ſpake before.</p>

                     <p>TO the two latter particulars ſomething may ſeem to be ſaid in that latter Paper; to the former that which is upon the ſecond branch of the third Objection, though every citation doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a man from being choſen a Commiſſioner, or ſitting as a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in a Generall Aſſembly, yet we think it will not be denyed that a citation in matter of ſcandall, in doctrine or manners, will or ought to exclude a man from being a Commiſsioner, or ſitting as a member in an Aſſembly, and ſuch was the citation appointed by
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:166443:84"/>
the late Commiſſioners, <hi>viz.</hi> in matter of ſcandall more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary (in the judgement of the Commiſsion) both in Doctrine and manners; Beſides, it is unqueſtionable that all citations do exclude men from being judges in the matter for which they are cited, therefore though they might have ſitten in the Aſſembly as judges in other matters, yet not in this; Therefore it followeth, that as to this particular which was the main, if not all to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the Aſſembly was prelimited. Anſwer <hi>1.</hi> To the latter part of this reply, I profeſs not much skill in the matter of legall exceptions, and conſtitution of Judicatories: but ſo far as common ſenſe and reaſon can lead me. It ſeems to me a ſtrange aſsertion that ſome few perſons having oppoſed themſelves to a courſe taken by a Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory, intruſted with the Publick affairs of the Kirk conſiſting of men to that time judged faithfull, and ſtill profeſsing faithfulneſs therein, as in the ſight of God, and accuſing this Judicatory for that courſe they have taken, as guilty of defection, and deſtroyers of the Cauſe of Religion, if I ſay, theſe few men being cited to be tryed by a Generall Aſsembly, and conſequently excluded from judging in that particular matter which is in controverſie; the Aſſembly is in this to be judged pre-limited in that matter, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be beſides theſe excluded a competent number of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers lawfully authorized: (For ſuch we may ſuppoſe all the reſt, to be for any thing that is ſaid in this particular that we are upon the anſwer of) to make up a competent Judicatory, to cognoſce, and judge upon the matter in controverſie, according to the rule of Gods Word, and the Conſtitutions of the Kirk, which they are bound by their Commiſsions and oaths to judge by; I deſire no proof of this, for it is principall clear and evident, <hi>exterminis,</hi> and the Writers aſsertion is no warr and to receive it for an unqueſtionable truth; I doubt not, but if the Writer ſhall aſsay to prove this, that he ſhall fall upon that ſame exception which the Remonſtrants made againſt the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> that the moſt part of the Synod were their adverſe party; having declared their judgement contrary to their doctrine; which was rejected as a null exception by all Orthodox Divines in that Synod.</p>

                        <p>BEfore the Author come directly to ſpeak to what is alleadged by the Writer, he ſeems firſt to anſwer by denying that there was any pre-limitation of the Aſſembly, even upon ſuppoſall that theſe men were by that Citation excluded from ſitting Members thereof; But let us conſider the Reaſons of his denyall. The firſt is, that there were but ſome few perſons oppoſing themſelves to a courſe taken by a Judicatory intruſted with the Publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Church, conſiſting of men (till that time) judged faithfull, and ſtill profeſsing faithfulneſſe therein, as in the ſight of God, and accuſing that Judicatory for that courſe they had taken, as guilty of defection, &amp;c. although they had been but few, yet their Teſtimony againſt the proceedings of that Judicatory, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the courſe of defection, notwithſtanding of any thing that that Judicatory had formerly been, and was then profeſsing, being true and clearly conſonant to the doctrine and determinations of this Church, it was a pre-limitation of the Aſſembly, becauſe of that Teſtimony to exclude them: But I have often told him, and made it to appear, that they were not few, but many. It is true, that the Commiſsion till that time had been judged faithfull; but it is alſo true, that a great part of theſe to whom that Teſtimony was due, did with-draw from the Commiſsion upon occaſion of that defection, and gave open teſtimony againſt the ſame. And though ſome eminent men did abide with them, yet the plurality were ſuch who had not been much converſant in, nor well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Publick Affairs of the Church. The other part of his Anſwer is, that there were beſides <hi>theſe excluded,</hi> a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent number of Members lawfully authorized (for ſuch as he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the reſt to be for any thing that is ſaid in this particular, that he is now upon the anſwer of) to make up a competent Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory, to cognoſce and judge upon that matter and controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, according to the rule of Gods Word, and the Conſtitution of the Kirk, which they are bound by their Commiſsions and oath to judge by. Yeelding all this, yet may there ſtill be a pre-limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, incaſe others no leſſe in capacity to be choſen to ſit as Judges, be excluded. If the Presbyteries by order of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:166443:85"/>
ſhall exclude a great many of their Members in a capacity to be choſen from being Commiſsioners, though they ſend a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent number of others, is not the Aſſembly pre-limited in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of its conſtituent Members, even as if the Barrons and Burghs ſhould exclude from their Elections many of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, in a capacity of being choſen Commiſsioners to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and yet ſend the ordinary number of Commiſsioners, would not the Parliament becauſe of this thing be pre-limited in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of its conſtituent Members? But in order to that which he ſaith of a competent Judicatory to cognoſce and judge upon the matter, according to the rules of Gods Word and Conſtitutions of the Kirk, and of the exceptions of the Remonſtrants made againſt the Synod of <hi>Dort:</hi> I deſire him to conſider firſt, of that which is ſaid of Mr. <hi>David Catherwood,</hi> a witneſs that deſerved well of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and whom (I believe) he will not except in this matter on his nullities againſt <hi>Pearth</hi> Aſſembly, and in his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate againſt confuſed Communions, concerning competent Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in a time of defection, and of what is ſaid of the ſame purpoſe, by the reforming Party in their Publick Papers in the year 1637. &amp; 1638. to whoſe judgments, I believe, the Proteſters will ſubmit in the matter of a competent Judge. Secondly, that if the exception of the Remonſtrants of the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> had been this, that the Members conſtituent of that Synod had declared their judgments not onely contrary to the doctrine of the Remonſtrants, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Word of God, and to the clear doctrine and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches, it would <hi>in jure</hi> have been a rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant exception, and being true <hi>in facto,</hi> had ſuſtained as well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that Synod, as the like exception againſt the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> which is to this day counted valid by all the Proteſtant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines. Thirdly, let us ſuppoſe <hi>hâc eadem viâ, ac modo &amp; metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> that the Commiſsion had brought in the Prelaticall or Popiſh Party, as they did the Malignant Party, and had by-Presbyteries o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying their order there anent, excluded all ſuch from being Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Aſſembly as did bear teſtimony againſt them, whoſe number we ſhall alſo ſuppoſe to be as few as the oppoſers of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Reſolutions, and the number of the other as many as theſe who are for them; whether would this have been a pre-limited Aſſembly, yea or not, and a Competent Judicatory to judge that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:166443:86"/>
matter according to the Word of God and Conſtitutions of the Church? All theſe things being put together, make it to appear that the Writer hath brought in no ſuch ſtraits in the buſines, as the Author ſuppoſeth.</p>

                     <p>SEcondly, To the former part of the Reply, I confeſſe that it is probable, that a man being cited to the Generall Aſſembly upon a ſcandall in doctrine and manners where the ſcandall is uncontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and already particularly determined <hi>quoad jus,</hi> or in point of Law, and the queſtion is only about the fact, ought not to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Commiſſioner to the Aſſembly, at leaſt not to ſit and vote untill he be tryed and judged; for I doubt, if he may not be choſen Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner, if there be not ſome probable preſumptions of the fact. But if the ſcandal be yet <hi>controverſi &amp; indeterminati juris,</hi> contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and as yet not a determined caſe in point of Law by the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Kirk, I ſee not but a man cited upon ſuch a ground, may be choſen a Commiſſioner to the Aſſembly, and ſit and vote as a Member in other matters, except that thereupon he was cited; and do remember well, that upon this very ground <hi>anno 48,</hi> upon the putting off of ſome from the Liſt to be Commiſſioners to the Aſsembly, who had been referred and cited to the Aſsembly for ſilence at that time, according to the direction of the then Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, exception was made by ſome, that ſuch perſons could not be choſen Commiſſioners, and conſequently could not be upon a Liſt. This motion was rejected by ſome judicious and pious, affirming indeed, that ſuch perſons could not well vote in the Aſsembly, until their matter was tryed, but that that reference could not hinder them to be upon a Liſt for elections, and conſequently not from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elected to be Commiſsioners. Now, ſuch was the caſe of the Citation in hand, it was upon alleadgeance of ſcandall, as yet <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſi juris,</hi> as to any particular determination thereanent by the publick judgment of the Kirk, and therefore both the perſons cited, and theſe that ordained them to be cited, were to be tryed and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Aſſembly, and for that removed in that particular, not only about the fact, but alſo about the matter <hi>Juris</hi> of Law. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever if this pleaſe not the Writer, let him anſwer what he will for
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:166443:86"/>
clearing the order of the Commiſſion <hi>48,</hi> and it will ſerve as well the order of the Commiſsion <hi>51.</hi> As to any illegality relating to the Conſtitution of the Aſſembly; for upon the form clearly both were alike, except in what wil make for the advantage of the later, and as for the matter in both it was alike, as to the Generall Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies judgment at the time of the Protestation, and alſo <hi>in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipſâ,</hi> which we take upon us to make good.</p>

                        <p>ALbeit this be more then probable, as appears from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant tenor of the proceedings of Aſſemblies in the matter of Commiſſioners, which was intimated by the Writer, yet I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to take what the Author gives. He diſtinguiſhes betwixt a ſcandal, which as to the ground of it is <hi>controverſi juris,</hi> &amp; a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall which is <hi>determinati juris,</hi> and makes the ſcandall of oppoſing the Publick Reſolutions to have been only <hi>controverſi juris,</hi> as to any particular determination thereof by the publick judgment of the Kirk, and thence infers, that the oppoſers of Publick Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons might have been choſen, this notwithſtanding, and admitted to ſit as Judges in the Aſſembly, though not in this particular; and I offer theſe particulars hereanent: Firſt, That by the Authors own grant, they are ſtill excluded from ſitting as Judges in that particular, and therefore as to a competent Judge in this particular, which was the main, if not the all of the Aſſembly, the Aſſembly was pre-limited. Secondly, That this was not a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which was <hi>controverſi juris,</hi> but as clearly <hi>determinati juris</hi> as any thing could be; I mean, that the oppoſing of the Publick Reſolutions, was no fault, but a duty clearly determined by the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi>; I confeſſe, men may queſtion any thing, even the cleareſt truths, but there is no caſe oftener or more clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by this Kirk, then that of the unwarrantableneſſe of joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Counſel or Arms with the Malignant Party, for the defence of the Cauſe and Kingdome, and of the obligation that lyeth upon Miniſters, eſpecially to bear teſtimony againſt the ſame; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a notable injury was done, and a groſſe pre-limitation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, by citing them upon that accompt. Thirdly, ſuppoſe it had not yet been <hi>determinati juris</hi> as to the publick judgment of the Church in an Aſſembly; yet as to the judgment of the Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:166443:87"/>
and Presbyteries who did hear and obey them, it was <hi>determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati juris,</hi> and men were excluded from Elections, and cited to the Aſſembly there-upon, as upon a thing that was <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minati juris:</hi> Therfore as there was thereby a pre-limitation in regard of theſe, who though they were choſen, yet could not ſit in that particular, becauſe of the Citation; ſo alſo in regard of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who were therby excluded from being choſen. 4. If this ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal was not (<hi>Determinati Juris</hi>) by the Publick Judgment of the Church, the Author would let us know why the Commiſſion in their Warnings at <hi>Perth, March</hi> 20 by applying many former Acts and Remonſtrances of Gen. Aſſemblies againſt it, do define it to be ſo: And what Warrant the Commiſſion had by their truſt from the Gen. Aſſembly, not only to declare the oppoſers of their Reſolutions to be guilty of practices leading to encourage the hearts, and ſtren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the hands of Enemies, in proſecuting their wicked purpoſes to make faint the hearts, and feeble the hands of Gods People, and to ſeduce their minds with deviſive and ſeparating Counſels and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and thereupon, not only to require Presbyteries to cenſure them, but alſo to ſtir up the Civil Magiſtrate againſt them. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if the Commiſſion did all this without any Publick Judgment of the Kirk (that is of former General Aſſemblies defining theſe things to be ſcandal) they did as to theſe things act without a Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and without Authority, and were beyond their bounds, and led with no ſpirit of tenderneſs. The Author did a little while agoe ſeem to ſay, That the Commiſſion had no power to cite or to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the oppoſers of any Reſolutions made by themſelves; and yet here he tels, that theſe things, as to the Publick Judgement of the Kirk, were <hi>controverſi juris</hi>: And if ſo, they were as yet but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions of their own, and they had no power to cite or cenſure any, or to give Order to cite or cenſure any for oppoſing thereof. That the Publick Reſolutions were <hi>controverſi,</hi> and not <hi>determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati juris</hi> by the publick judgement of the Kirk: That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion had no power for citing or cenſuring any Oppoſing Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made by themſelves; That they gave Order to Presbyteries to cenſure and cite the oppoſers of Publick Reſolutions, are things that I cannot reconcile. I wil not ſay but the Authors ingyne may find a ſhift, but if he extricate theſe things to the clear capacity of plain and ordinary underſtandings, is more then at preſent my weak
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:166443:87"/>
eyes do ſee. As for that he tells us concerning the rejecting the motion of putting off of ſome from the Liſt to be Commiſſioners, who had been referred and cited to the Aſſembly in the year 1648. I can ſay little to it, as not knowing it nor the circumſtances ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. I beleeve it be an inſtance of a particular perſon in a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery giving his judgment anent the liſting of another, but when it is all granted it yeelds a great part of the cauſe, to wit, That theſe perſons could not ſit in the Aſſembly as Judges in that particular; And if I be not miſtaken in my conjecture about the perſons, I think I may ſay, if that judicious and pious man who rejected that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had been in any fear that theſe perſons would be choſen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like he would have holden his peace, and ſufferred the motion to paſſe uncontrolled. But the Author (if this pleaſe not the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) deſires him to anſwer what he will for clearing of the Order of the Commiſſion 48. and it will ſerve aſwell the Order of the Commiſsion 51. as to any illegality relating to the Conſtitution of the Aſſembly; becauſe, ſaith he, upon the form both clearly were alike, excepting what will make for the advantage of the latter; and as for the matter in both it was alike, as to the General Aſſemblies Judgment at the time of the Proteſtation, and alſo <hi>in reipſa,</hi> as he takes upon him to make good. It ſeems that it doth not pleaſe the Author himſelf very wel, and I think it wil pleaſe the Writer much worſe, becauſe of the things which I have mentioned, and other things as weighty which may occur to him, as to that of the 48. I have already given clear anſwers for the writer, or rather vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated his own, that there was a vaſt difference both in the form as alſo in the matter; and that both, as the Aſſemblies judgement at the time of the Proteſtation (unleſs they were not to admit the judgment of former Aſſemblies in theſe particulars) as alſo <hi>in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipſa,</hi> and he ſhall but loſe his labor, and not be able to make good what he undertakes.</p>

                     <p>THat which may ſeem to ſay ſomewhat againſt the other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular (<hi>viz.</hi> That no mans Commiſſion was rejected, nor any man choſen to be a Commiſſioner was refuſed to have vote in the Aſſembly upon that accompt, that he was unſatisfied with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions) is in the Anſwer to the <hi>3.</hi> Objection, Branch <hi>4.</hi> Firſt,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:166443:88"/>
(beſide ſomthing that hath been anſwered already) he ſaith, Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie taught the Aſſembly ſo to do: The votes of ſo few a number not being likely to prove ſo great diſadvantage to the buſineſſe, as the profeſſed denying to them a vote would have done. <hi>Anſwer,</hi> If the Writer had uſed ſo much modeſty and reſpect to the Aſſembly as to have ſaid, That poſſibly Policy might have taught them to do this, or it may be probably thought it was thus, it had been ſomewhat tolerable: But I muſt ſay it is too much boldneſſe thus to have ſaid, poſitively, That Policy did teach them it. Good Sir, did you ſee into the hearts of men in the Aſſembly, to ſee this poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical deſign moving them to do this? Or can you bring a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration from any evidence without, that their doing of it, did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from no other principle or motive but this? But if it be ſo that they did it upon a political motive and end: yet if it was ſo really as none was rejected or refuſed, to have vote upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of diſſatisfaction, that exception is to no purpoſe to the point. We are upon the freedom of the Aſſembly, which is to be meaſured by the acts done about the Conſtitution and managing of it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered according to the Matter of them, and not according to the Intentions and Moral Motives whereupon men does them. But the Writer does add two things further for Anſwer. <hi>1.</hi> That the diſcuſſing and judging of the Commiſſions of theſe in <hi>Glaſgow</hi> and <hi>Sterling,</hi> who were unſatisfied with the publick reſolutions, were laid aſide; becauſe Mr. <hi>Rob Ramſay</hi> his Proteſtation againſt the Election, taken from their Diſſatisfaction, could not be diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, until theſe Reſolutions were either condemned, or approven, which was in effect to exclude them from voting, becauſe of not approving the Publick Reſolutions; and this is ſo much the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, conſidering that it was refuſed to lay aſide the Commiſſions of theſe that carried on the Reſolutions until their proceedings ſhould be tryed and approven. <hi>Anſw. 1.</hi> Beſides that Mr. <hi>R. Ramſay</hi> his Proteſtation was not againſt theſe of <hi>Sterling</hi> at all, ſo that it is impertinent to ſay, that their Commiſsion was laid aſide becauſ of that Proteſtation: And beſides, that the Commiſsions of others controverting with them, and pretending by as probable reaſons their Commisſion as theſe, was laid aſide alſo. It followeth not hence that they were ſimply excluded from voting, but ſuſpended from voting for a time, and had not vote in that particular which might well had been without imputation of pre-limitation on the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:166443:88"/>
Aſsembly, as hath been ſhewen before. <hi>2.</hi> The Conſideration added for confirmation is very inconſiderable; becauſe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misſions of theſe of <hi>Glaſgow</hi> and <hi>Sterling</hi> were controverted in the very Election, and therfore their Commisſion could not but be laid aſide untill the grounds of the Controverſie ſhould be diſcuſſed, that it might be ſeen whether they were orderly elected, or not; but theſe others had their Commisſion by Elections orderly and uncontrover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Presbyteries that ſent them; yet neither were they to have vote in the matter of the Reſolutions. What is ſaid from the Exception made againſt their Admisſion to vote at all, given in to the Aſſembly, ſhall be anſwered afterwards. Secondly (ſaith he) it is to be conſidered, That the Aſſembly did ſuſtain &amp; approve the Letter and Act of the Commisſion for citing ſuch as were unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, which was a real excluding of all theſe upon their disſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, at leaſt from being Judges in that particular. <hi>Anſw. 1.</hi> The Writer doth here, as all along this Paper, bear his Reader in hand, that the Commisſion hath given order for citing ſuch as were unſatisfied indefinitly, which is contrary to the truth; for only ſuch (as all means uſed, do continue in oppoſing) were to be cited, as is evident by the Act and Letter. <hi>2</hi> It is true, after tryal and examination of the Commisſions proceedings, they did approve that Act and Letter: But did not the Aſſembly, <hi>48.</hi> do the ſame in relation to the Letter and Act of the then Commisſion of the like nature? But yet further, Did not all Commisſioners from Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries, who were unſatisfied (excepting ſuch only whoſe Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were controverted in the very Election) were yet undiſcuſſed, and were pleaſed to ſtay in the Aſſembly, ſit and vote in that ſame very particular; I mean the Reſolutions of the Commiſſion, how then could they be really excluded from being Judges in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular wherein they really did ſit Judges; or were any of them excluded after the Act and Letter was approven? If it be ſaid, That the approving of that Act and Letter did import, that they ought in the judgment of the Aſſembly to have been excluded. <hi>I</hi> anſwer, <hi>1.</hi> Yet though this may ſay ſomewhat, that the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies determination in this point <hi>de jure</hi> did not agree wel with that pre-ceding <hi>fact</hi> in admitting ſuch Members to judge in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, yet it ſaith nothing to the point in hand, ſeeing theſe Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of whom we ſpeak did really and actually without any Letter or exception made againſt them Judg, not only in other matters, but
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:166443:89"/>
alſo in that very particular. Thus much in anſwer to the firſt Reaſon againſt the late Aſſembly, and what is brought in that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for confirming and upholding of it: If it have any force Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants may think themſelves obliged to the Proteſters for tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching them, if ever they ſhall have power again, how to call in queſtion and condemn their Aſſembly <hi>48.</hi> yea, and if they find it make for their purpoſe, even other Aſsemblies too, even that Solemn Aſsembly <hi>38.</hi> as unfree and unlawful, becauſe of pre limitation in the election of Commiſſioners.</p>

                        <p>THe Author here pasſing by a great and material part of the Writers Anſwer, to wit, That albeit all that were true, yet it doth not make void what is ſaid for prelimiting the Elections by the Letter and Act of the Commisſion, becauſe theſe were prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Presbyteries, by barring ſundry from being choſen, who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe were in a capacity to be choſen, falleth upon ſharp cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of him, for ſaying, That Policy taught the Aſſembly ſo to do. But I conceive that though the writer did not ſee into the hearts of men in the Aſſembly, yet he had reaſon thus to ſpeak, becauſe their admitting ſome of them to ſit, was not conſonant nor homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious neither to the Letter and Act for citing of them, which by the Authors own grant did infer the barring of them from ſitting til their matters ſhould be tryed; nor yet to the Aſſemblies aproving of the Letter and Act which did exclude them, which the Author alſo confeſſes; it was either great policy, or great ſimplicity that did lead them in ſo contrary and diſcordant parts; But as the Author elſ-where ſpeaks, they were no children; neither was it ſo really that none were rejected or refuſed to have vote upon the accompt of diſ-ſatisfaction, becauſe as ſome of them were rejected <hi>de facto,</hi> to wit, the Commisſioners of the firſt Election in <hi>Glaſgow</hi>; ſo all of them were rejected <hi>de jure</hi> as we ſhall hear anone. It could not but flow from ſome ſtrange principle, and be matter of wonder to the beholders, That at the ſame time, in the ſame Judicatory, ſome ſhould be ſtanding at the Bar, as <hi>rei,</hi> and cited to be tryed and jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and others no leſs guilty of the ſame Crime ſhould be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſit upon the Bench as Judges of that very particular. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the Author ſhal not find many preſidents nor paralels of ſuch
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:166443:89"/>
a practice as this in any well conſtitute and rightly proceeding Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory Civil or Eccleſiaſtick; ſo that meaſuring the freedom of the Aſſembly by the Acts done about the conſtitution and mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of it according to the matter of it, and not according to the intentions or moral motives upon which men did them: There is ſtill reaſon to ſay, that it was not free, notwithſtanding that ſome were admitted to ſit and vote, who were unſatisfied with, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit to the publick reſolutions. As to that which he ſayeth in Anſwer to the other two particulars: To the firſt of them I deſire it to be conſidered. 1. That the impertinency is on his own ſide, when he ſaith, that Mr. <hi>Rob. Ramſay</hi> his Proteſtation was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe of <hi>Sterling</hi> at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe the Writer did not at all ſay in writ that it was ſo, or that the Commiſſion of <hi>Sterling</hi> was laid aſide, becauſe of that Proteſtation; if he found it ſo written in any Copy, it had ſavoured a little more of cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>iry to impute to the inadvertence of the Tranſcriber, ſeeing no man belike of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe would bring in Mr. <hi>Rob. Ramſay</hi> a Member of another Presbytery, and in another Province, proteſting againſt the Election of <hi>Sterling. 2.</hi> Not to fall on the debate of the laying of the other Commiſſions aſide, which were controverted with them, not upon the probableneſs, nor improbableneſs of the reaſons they pretended, as not belonging much to the buſines which we are now upon. The Author doth yeeld much of the cauſe when he ſaith, It followes not hence that they were ſimply excluded from voting, but ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from voting for a time, and had not vote in that particular; becauſe he yeelds theſe two things: 1. That they had not, nor were not to have (<hi>de jure</hi>) any vote at all in the particular of the Publick Reſolutions. 2. That (<hi>de facto</hi>) they had not, nor were not to have a vote in any particular till that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception ſhould be diſcuſſed, and ſo are they excluded for a long time, and from many particulars. But when the exception is diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ſuſtained, are they not wholly excluded, both <hi>de jure,</hi> and <hi>de facto,</hi> and cannot at all be admitted, unleſs we will bring in the Aſſembly going over the belly of what ſhe hath preſently found juſt and reaſonable; neither is it ſo inconſiderable as the Author would make it, which is added by the Writer for Confirmation, but is very conſiderable to evince the pre-limiting of the Aſſembly. That which was added is this, <hi>and this is ſo much the ſtronger,</hi> if we ſhall conſider that it was refuſed to lay aſide the Commiſſions
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:166443:90"/>
of theſe who had carried on theſe Reſolutions in the Commiſſion of the Aſſembly, until their proceedings ſhould be tryed and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. To which the Authors Anſwer is, That it is not conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe the Commiſſion of the one was controverted in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, but ſo was not the other; and becauſe they were not to have vote in the matter of the Reſolutions; but this doth not at all looſe the difficulty. One of the grounds upon which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the one was controverted in the Elections, was, becauſe the perſons elected were oppoſers of the Publick Reſolutions, and that ground aſwel as others, did to themwards ſuſtain as a relevant exception <hi>in jure</hi> to keep them from ſitting and voting in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, not only in that, but alſo in any particular elſe, until it ſhould be diſcuſſed; yea, ſome of the Commiſſioners were ſuſpended from having a vote in any thing till that ſhould be diſcuſſed, meerly and allenerly upon that ground, to wit, That Brother who was nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in both the Elections; Now was not to be the Author or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>better of the Publick Reſolutions, involving a courſe of defection, being objected at the down-ſitting of the Aſſembly, an exception as relevant <hi>in jure</hi> to bar thoſe who were choſen by their Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, without any controverſie in the Presbytery it ſelf, from ſitting and voting in the Aſſembly in any particular until that Exception ſhould be tryed as the other was, though objected in the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery at the time of the Election. Let us take the Authors ground (to wit) That the matter was <hi>controverſi,</hi> and not <hi>determinati juris,</hi> and let him or any man elſe vindicate it from partiality and pre-limitation, that exceptions being propounded <hi>hinc inde,</hi> he who carries on Publick Reſolutions ſhall be admitted to ſit in all other particulars, except in the trying and judging of theſe, and he who oppoſes them ſhall be ſuſpended from ſitting in any particular til theſe be tryed and Judged. On what he ſaith to the ſecond par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular I offer, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>. That the Writer doth not all along this Paper bear his Reader in hand (as the Author alleadges) that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion had given order for citing ſuch as were unſatisfied indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly, becauſe the very firſt time that he mentions the Letter and Act of the Commiſſion he ſaith, That it was a Letter and Act ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing, That ſuch as after conference ſhould remain unſatisfied with, and continue to oppoſe the Publick Reſolutions, ſhould be cited; and having thus once ſet down the true nature and extent of it, it was needleſs as often as he ſpake of it to repeat the ſame

That it helps him not to ſay, That as the Aſſembly 51. did ratify the Letter and Act of the Commiſſion, ſo alſo did the Aſſembly 48. becauſe of the many differences already eſtabliſhed betwixt the one and the other. To which I ſhall now add this as to the point of Ratification, That the Act and Letter 48. was not contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by any, nor any Elections becauſe of it, nor any Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on proponed thereupon againſt the freedom of the Aſſembly; nor indeed well could be, it being clothed with ſuch circumſtances as we have formerly ſpoken of which needs not now to be repeated; but in 51. it was controverted, and Elections therupon were queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and Exceptions thereupon proponed againſt the freedom of the General Aſſembly, which were rejected, notwithſtanding of contrary circumſtances wherewith the Letter and Act were clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed. 3. That the Author by yeelding, that the Aſſemblies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of the Letter and Act of the Commiſſion (which he is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate to yeeld becauſe it was ſo) doth import, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Oppoſers did ſit<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:166443:91"/>
Aſſembly, and what is ſet down for confirming and upholding of it in the other Paper, being now fully diſcuſſed, I leave it to the Reader to judge, whether that Reaſon of the Proteſtation doth not ſtill ſtand ſtrong againſt the freedom and lawfulneſs of that Aſſembly, and how little cauſe he hath to ſay, That if it have any force, Malignants may think themſelves obliged to the Proteſters for teaching them, if ever they ſhall have power again, how to call in queſtion and condemn the Aſſembly 1648. yea, and if they find it move for their purpoſe, even other Aſſembles too, even that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Aſſembly 1638. as unfree and unlawful, becauſe of the pre-limitation of Election of Commiſſioners thereto. The Malignants are in themſelves prone enough to evil inventions though they be not taught them by others, but I beleeve (themſelves being Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges) they had rather, as to the matter of conſtitution of Aſſemblies, and the interpretation of their Acts, be Diſciples to the Authors and Abetters of the Publick Reſolutions then to the Proteſters; for they have there in a little time learned the way how (notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of all former Acts excluding them) to be admitted to all the priviledges of the Church, and to be imployed both in the Army and Judicatories, and by complying with the Commiſſion to get an Aſſembly after their own mind for ratifying and approving all theſe things which would never have been taught unto them by the Proteſters, who ſtudies to hold faſt the Acts of Aſſemblies in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Malignants in the genuine and litteral ſenſe and meaning thereof, and to prevent and oppoſe all corrupt conſtitutions of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, and that they may be compoſed of ſuch as do adhere to former Principles, which being attained, there is no cauſe to fear that Malignants ſhall eaſily ranverſe either the Aſſembly 48. or the Aſſembly 38. or any other <hi>lawful free General Aſsembly</hi> of this Church.

                     <p>WE go on now to the ſecond in order of the Proteſtation, which is this; Becauſe of the abſence of Commiſsioners of many Burghs, as wanting free acceſſe becauſe of the motions of the Enemy, in the order of the late Paper, wherein other reaſons are added to theſe in the Proteſtation, this is ſet down in the <hi>5.</hi> place and is caſt in <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> with ſome addition to the matter, becauſe as firſt proponed it hath not ſeemed faſt enough thus: That cannot be a free Aſſembly, to which there is no free acceſs and receſs, but there was no free acceſſe to the Aſsembly by reaſon of two Armies interjacent between the place of the meeting and the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of many of the Commiſsioners, and being purſuing one another very hotely, having their parties comming abroad every where at the time they ſhould had come to the Aſsembly, and therefore ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were abſent about the one halfe of the Burghs, many Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries to the number of <hi>9.</hi> or <hi>10.</hi> neither was there free receſs from it, not onely becauſe of the former reaſon, but becauſe the King and Committee of Eſtates did detain and keep under a kind of confinement, ſeverall numbers thereof, at their returning to their own homes, having nothing, nor alleadging any thing to challenge them for, but their carriage at the Aſsembly. Anſwer, I muſt profeſs ingenuouſly, when at firſt I did read the Proteſtation, I wondred much how men, eſpecially Miniſters of the Goſpell, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſo ſolemn and high profeſsion and atteſtation as they do in this Proteſtation, <hi>viz.</hi> That they made one of the grounds contained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as being deſirous to be faithful in the day of tentation, and to exoner their conſciences as in the ſight of the LORD, could alleadg this as ground to diſclaim the late Aſſembly, as not a free and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Aſſembly of this Kirk. I confeſs my wondring is not a whit abated, but increaſed by this ſecond propounding Argumentation of it. For firſt, As to the propoſal of it in the Proteſtation, ſuppoſe that a good many Commiſsioners of Broughs and Presbyteries had been abſent then: this might have been alleadged with ſome appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of reaſon to ſhow that the Aſſembly was not ſo ful <hi>in partibus integralibus,</hi> ſo numerous as could have been wiſhed, yet with no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour could it be alleadged, that it was not free, legal <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

either that their abſence was for want of timous advertiſment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the time and place of it, which cannot be alleadged (the time being known by the preceding Aſsembly, and advertiſment concerning the place having been given timouſly by the Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) or that there was ſome appearance that ſome in the Aſſembly might have been inclined to act favourably for the enemy, or that the enemy might have ſome influence on the Aſsembly to corrupt or pervert it, which I conceive the Proteſtors wil not ſay. I know that the abſence of many Commiſſioners is alleadged as one ground anulling this pretended Aſsembly condemned at <hi>Glaſgow 38.</hi> but it is as wel known that the abſence of Commiſſioners was cauſed by untimous indiction and advertiſment or ſome other internal cauſe, having influence upon the corruption of this Aſsembly. <hi>2.</hi> It had been requiſit the Writer of the laſt Paper had condeſcended namely upon theſe <hi>9.</hi> or <hi>10.</hi> Presbyteries abſent; which had he done, I doubt but it would have been found that ſome of them were abſent, becauſe they had none to ſend, or were not Presbyteries exiſting at all at that time, as <hi>Orknay</hi> and <hi>Caithneſs. 2.</hi> It ſhould be found that ſome of theſe Commisſioners of Presbyteries came within ſhort ſpace to the place where the Aſsembly was ſitting, and would not come for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to it, as for inſtance theſe of <hi>Hambleton. 3.</hi> Commisſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers came to the Aſsembly, between whom and the place of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly the Armies were as interjacent, as to thoſe that came not; for did not Commisſioners from Presbyteries of <hi>Mer<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

So, if becauſe of the abſence of ſome Commiſsioners, for fear of the motions of the Enemy, or becauſe of lying of Armies through the Countrey, the late Aſſembly be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unfree and unlawfull; Then, by as good reaſon muſt the Aſsem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in the time of <hi>James Graham</hi> his reigning and raging through the Countrey, be holden unfree; for as many, if not m<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners were upon that occaſion abſent from the ſame Aſsembly; then ſee here again how good friends our Brethren proves to the former Aſsembly, by deviſing arguments againſt the late Aſsembly, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:166443:92"/>
they plainly teach Malignants who were cenſured by this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, how to caſt them as nul upon grounds of conſcience. Sixthly, let the Rols of this Aſsembly, be compared with the Rolls of former unqueſtioned Aſsemblies, and it ſhall be found to have been more numerous and full, then ſundries of them; yea, we know, that at the Aſsembly of <hi>Aberdeen 1650.</hi> there were but about twenty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons preſent, which notwithſtanding is owned by the Kirk of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> as a free and lawfull Generall Aſsembly, and it cannot be ſaid, that any ſuch excuſe as this was made in that Aſsembly for the abſence of any, and granting that the motions of the Enemy had hindered ſome, yet here being ſo inconſiderable a number in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of this Aſsembly, theſe who were conveened, ſhould not, nor could not lawfully be holden an Aſsembly, and gone about their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Seventhly, as for what was ſaid about the want of freedom of receſs, the firſt part is certain and clear in common ſenſe, that if any Aſsembly may ſit, or do ſit out its time, and conclude freely, though there be danger to the Members in their receſs, this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in any way reflect upon the conſtitution of the Aſsembly, how many Members of the Aſsembly in <hi>James Grahames</hi> time were there that had not ſafe receſs to their own homes. For the other part of theſe Members ſpoken of here, had proteſted againſt, and declined the Aſsembly, and deſerted (which the Writer wiſely paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in ſilence, and ſaies only they were returning to their own homes: as if for ſooth the Aſsembly had been cloſed, or that they had taken fair leave before the cloſe) And might not the King and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee do all this? They ſay unto them, until they had been infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med upon what ground they had come away ſo untimouſly without any imputation to the freedom and lawfulneſs of the Aſſembly: Did not the Commiſſioners of the States at the Aſſembly of <hi>Dort</hi> when the Remonſtrants proceeded againſt, and declined that Synod, preſently confined and charged them to bide within that City un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they ſhould anſwer unto the Aſſembly, without any imputation to the freedom of that Aſſembly. But again, the truth is this, upon the Proteſters deſerting of the Aſsembly, and going through the Army towards the Weſt, the report was, That they had made a broil in the Aſsembly, and were come to trouble the Army, and hinder the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies appointed in the ſaid places, whither they were going: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the King and the Committee required ſome to keep their Chambers til their carriage in the Aſsembly might be known. But
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:166443:93"/>
ſo ſoon as the Aſsembly heard of this, they diſpatched unto the King, who preſently ſent them all to their own homes, excepting that they did require ſuch of them as were cited to the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> to return to it, and anſwer for themſelvs (which yet I cannot ſay, was certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done) without one croſs word given to them. Theſe things being conſidered, impartial judicial Readers will acknowledge that there hath not bin much ingenuity or conſcience either in alleadging this reaſon for annulling the late <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> and cannot but think the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadgers themſelves wil bluſh that here have propounded it for ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying their own proteſting, and hold it forth to others to induce them to joyn with them as a ground of conſcience whereof they could not but exoner their conſcience.</p>

                        <p>THe Author uſhers in and cloſes his Anſwer to this reaſon with a great deal of wondering, and many exclamations againſt the want of ingenuity and conſcience in the Proteſters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of alleadging this reaſon againſt the freedome and lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Aſſembly; and he is ſo confident as to think, when his Anſwers are conſidered, not onely will his Readers be of one minde with him in this, but that the Proteſters themſelves will bluſh that they have proponed it: We have a proverb, That great words flyeth bairns; and ſo we may alſo ſay, Great words per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades women and children, but men of reaſon and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will ponder what is ſaid. Albeit the Proteſters did not lay all, nor moſt of the weight of their Proteſtation againſt the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly upon this, yet they did ingenuouſly and conſcientiouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that there was weight in it, and do think ſo ſtill, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of all the Authors great words: I wiſh he had taken the Propoſitions of the Arguments as they lay, and anſwered them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally and diſtinctly; he doth not (ſo far as my weak decerning can reach) tell us his mind plainly and directly, either of the firſt or ſecond Propoſition of the Argument, but ſpeaks directly onely to theſe things that are brought by the Writer, for confirmation of the ſecond Propoſition; and to that part of the firſt Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that relates to freedome of receſſe; I ſhall firſt ſpeak a little to the firſt Propoſition of the Argument, and then to the application of it.

been generally received and made uſe of by Divines, to prove the unfreedome of Councels where there was truth in it; as to the matter of fact, as appears firſt from the learned Review of the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> in which this Argument is cleared and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed at large.

                           </gap>ng of it; That ſeverall Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, becauſe of the tumults of theſe times, could not meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their own bounds to chooſe Commiſsioners, but made their Elections in places far remote, as theſe of the Presbyteries of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and <hi>Hadingtoun.</hi> Secondly, That many Miniſters thought it not ſafe to ſtay with their own flocks, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired Northwards, ſome to one place, ſome to another. Thirdly, None could at that time travell ſafely on the South-ſide of Forth without a Paſs from the Engliſh, which was not eaſie to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed, and could not be taken without ſuſpicion; and therefore though ſundry did hazard to ſteal through, yet ſome were taken priſoners and ſent back, as ſundry Miniſters in the Presbyterie of <hi>Lithgow.</hi> 4. To ſay nothing of theſe many reproches that were caſt upon, &amp; many threatnings that were uſed againſt ſundry of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of Publick Reſolutions, by the Souldiours in their journey to St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and in the place, and in their returning from it, all of them were before that time declared Enemies both to Church
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:166443:94"/>
and Kingdome, and Laws made by the Parliament, and Acts iſſued by the Commiſſion to proceed againſt them with puniſhments and cenſures; and doth not the Author in this his Vindication tell us, that therefore the Clerks Papers which he ſent to the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, were not read, leaſt they ſhould have inferred hazard and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to him; if then he had been there perſonally, and ſpoken the ſame things in the Aſſembly that he wrote unto it, which no doubt if he had been preſent, he would have thought himſelf bound in Conſcience to do, he could not have done it with ſafety, and yet theſe were things relating to the Publick Reſolutions. All theſe things being put together, do make it to appear, that acceſſe to the Aſſembly wes not ſafe, but full of hazard and danger. But I come to the Author his Anſwers, and in order thereto, deſire it to be conſidered: Firſt, That as the want of integrant parts ſometimes may be ſo great, that it doth deſtroy the very being of the body; ſo, when a conſiderable number of integrant parts are wanting, it renders the body weak in its functions and operations, and drawes along with it many other inconveniences. I doubt not but the Author will grant, that the number of Commiſſioners coming to an Aſſembly, may be ſo few, that they cannot make a lawfull and free Aſſembly; as upon the other ſide I ſhall willingly yeeld, that it is not every want of Members conſtituent, that makes an unfree or unlawful Aſſembly, if either the one or the other ſhould be denied: As two or three Commiſſioners might make an Aſſembly, ſo the want of two or three might unmake it. I think he will alſo grant that when many Commiſſioners are abſent, eſpecially not negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, but upon relevant cauſes that it is not fit to adjourn it till another time, then to proceed to conſtitute themſelves or act as an Aſſembly. So our VVorthy Reformers adjourned the Aſſembly 1568. from Decemb. 25. to Feb. 25. becauſe many were abſent by reaſon of the troubles of the time: and upon the ſame ground the Aſſembly 1569. was adjourned from February to March, from <hi>Sterling</hi> to <hi>Edenburgh.</hi> And if the Meeting at S. <hi>Andrews</hi> had been pleaſed to read and condeſcend unto the Supplication that was offered to them under the Hands of many Brethren for an adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before their Conſtitution, there had been no cauſe for theſe Debates. 2. It ſeems to be yeelded by the Author, that wher it can be demonſtrated that a good many Commiſſioners are abſent, for want of timous advertiſment, concerning the time and place of the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:166443:94"/>
Aſsembly, there is cauſe upon that ground to except againſt the Aſſembly, as not free and lawful. And the Aſſembly at <hi>Glaſgow</hi> did put it above queſtion for anulling the pretended Aſsemb. at <hi>Lithgo</hi> 1606 &amp; that at <hi>Aberdeen</hi> 1616. And is it not equivalent to this, if by reaſon of external force Presbyteries after advertiſment given unto them cannot meet and chooſ their Commiſſioners, or if thoſe who are choſen cannot come becauſe of force keeping them back, VVhat is the cauſe why undue advertiſment of many Presbyteries and Bu<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

Is it not becauſe many of theſe who are in a capacity to ſend Commiſſioners, are by an invincible impediment kept back from doing of it; and hath not this alſo place in the other caſe?

Though the Presbyteries of <hi>Orknay</hi> and <hi>Caithneſs</hi> be deduced, and others too which are wanting and have no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners to ſend: yet if the Author ſhal be pleaſed to conſult the Rolls of the Aſſembly, it haply may be ſtill found that nine or ten Presbyteries were abſent, and thirty Burroughs if not above: for theſe of <hi>Hamelton</hi> who came afterwards to the place where the Aſſembly was ſiting, and would not come forward, as they came thither with hazard and difficulty, ſo did they not think it a duty to come forward, being convinced of the nullity of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, which made them ſend their teſtimony againſt it; It is true that Commiſsioners came to the Aſſembly, betwixt whom and the place of the Aſſembly the Armies were interjacent, and from ſeverall parts beſouth <hi>Forth</hi>; but it is as true, that ſome comming from theſe places were taken priſoners, and that others offered not to come from home as being hopeleſſe to paſſe thorough the danger, bring ſo apparent and reall, which it ſeems the Author hath been ſomewhat convinced of, when he ſpeaks ſo mincingly as to ſay that it might have ſeemed to have proceeded of negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, rather then of any neceſſity: He tels us that Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners came not from Burghes, and yet Miniſters came from the ſame Burghs, but that proves not that there was free acceſſe
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:166443:95"/>
to the Commiſſioners of Burghs who ſtayed away; to ſay nothing that there was few Burghs whoſe Commiſſioners were abſent, whoſe Miniſters were Commiſsioners and came to the Aſſembly; I know not any Aſſembly ſo impeded and indangered in <hi>Ja. Grahams</hi> time; there was no Aſſembly that ſate from the time of his invading the Land by the <hi>Iriſhes</hi> till the time of his defeat except one, and that ſate in <hi>Jan.</hi> at which time he was not reigning or raging thorough much of the Country, but was forced to keep himſelf in the Highlands, and in the places of the Country leſſe inhabited, whence few Commiſsioners were come: If the Author prove it, by bringing forth the Rolls ot both Aſſemblies, that as many were abſent from that Aſſembly if not more, then it ſhall appear that he had juſt cauſe ſo to aſſert; but until that time he will give us leave to ſuſpend our aſſent to the truth of this. He will ſtil have the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſters to be unfriends to former Aſſemblies, and to be teachers of Malignants how to caſt them as null upon grounds of Conſcience; but the Proteſters do diſclaim them for Scollers, and ſo do they the Proteſters for maſters or teachers; and as there is nothing taught by the Proteſters that can give them any juſt ground upon which to quarrell or caſt the cenſures of that Aſſembly, ſo were it ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous for them now to be at the pains to learn it, ſeeing the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and abbettors of the Publick Reſolutions hath eaſed them of the pain of this cenſure already, albeit the Rolls of this Aſſembly were more numerous then the Roll of ſome unqueſtionable Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies that would not much help him, becauſe abſents from this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly in many was not voluntary, but by want of free acceſſe, but ſo doth it not appear to have been in other Aſſemblies, and whatever the Author talks of the Roll of this Aſſembly; yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve before they come to the ratifying of the Publick Reſolutions which was their great buſineſſe, they were but a thin Meeting, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their number having left them, ſome out of diſcontent and diſſatisfaction with their proceedings, and others fearing to be ſurprized by parties of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>: As to the Aſſembly at <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deen,</hi> in which there was but twenty perſons preſent which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding is owned by the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> as a free and lawfull Generall Aſſembly; it is ſo owned as that theſe who met being lawfully Commiſsionated from their Presbyteries, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving met at the time and place appointed for holding the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, are accounted ſufficient to adjourn the Aſſembly, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve

and Vindicate the Liberties of the Church againſt the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments that then were made upon them by the King and his Commiſsioners: So I believe the Author will not ſay that theſe twenty could have proceeded to make Acts of Generall concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the whole Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> or that if they had ſo done, theſe acts would have been authoritative &amp; binding. What the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpeaks of want of freedome, in regard of receſſe is not upon any emergent after the down-ſitting or cloſe of the Aſſembly, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon cauſes known at the time when the Commiſsioners ſhould have come from home, and therefore he doth not urge it as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levant Argument apart by it ſelf, but joynes it with the want of freedome of acceſſe, and it is very agreeable to common ſenſe for men to think that Aſſembly not free, to which there is no free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in comming to exoner their Conſciences; nor any freedom in going after they have done it. He juſtifies the confinement of the Miniſters of <hi>Sterline.</hi> In this particular at <hi>Sterline</hi> 1. He chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth the Writers paſsing in ſilence, theſe Miniſters Proteſting againſt the Aſſembly, but though the Author think this wiſdome yet I hardly believe that the Writer did it upon deliberation, the thing being ſo manifeſtly known, there was no need to mention it; The Author asks the queſtion, whether the King might not have confined theſe men, without any imputation to the freedome of the Aſſembly, untill he had been informed upon what ground they came away ſo untimeouſly. It ſeems that as the caſe was circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiat, it could not well be done without an imputation of the freedome of the Aſſembly; may the King and Committee confine every one who comes away untimeouſly, untill they be informed upon what ground they come away, <hi>illud poſsumus quod Jure poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumus</hi>: But where is there ſuch law, for cenſuring theſe by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement that come away untimeouſly from the Aſſembly; but it ſeems they were informed of the cauſe of their comming away, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe his inſtance of the Commiſsioners of the Eſtates at the Aſſembly of <hi>Dort,</hi> their confining of the Remonſtrants, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them to bide within the City till they ſhould anſwer to the Aſſembly, after they had Proteſted againſt, and declined the ſame, will not make much to the purpoſe to juſtifie the confinement at <hi>Sterline,</hi> becauſe that at <hi>Dort</hi> was not but upon certain knowledge and information of the fact, and if the King or Committee did know that theſe Miniſters had Proteſted, how doth the Author inſinuate that it was done untill they ſhould

                     <p>THe third Reaſon according to the order of the Proteſtation, and ſecondly in the order of the late Paper is this in ſumme: that the late Aſsembly cannot be counted a free lawfull Generall Aſsembly; becauſe relevant exceptions being timeouſly proponed and offered to be inſtructed and verified againſt many of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof; <hi>viz.</hi> Such of the late Commiſſion as had hand in the Publick Reſolutions, that they ſhould not be permitted to ſit and Vote in the Aſsembly, as being under a ſcandall, and guilty of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting a courſe of defection, and untill ſuch time as they ſhould be tryed, yet it was refuſed to take any ſuch exceptions into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, until they ſhould be tryed and diſcuſsed.

The Writer ſaid not, that it was without controverſie; but his words be theſe; <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit (as we conceive) no great controverſie will be about it</hi>: And although he had ſaid, that it is without controverſie, was it a fault to bring ſomething for ſtrengthening aſſent to the truth of it. That he named no paſſage of the Word of God was, becauſe he took it to be <hi>lippis &amp; tonſoribus notum</hi> amongſt Chriſtians, that an El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhould be blameleſſe, and of good report. A ſecond is, That it is good that the writer, yea even in this heat of diſputation, finds ſomething right in the Commiſſioners Papers, out that he tells not all the truth. The Writer deſires not at any time to be ſo hot againſt the Commiſſion, as not to acknowledge and commend what is right in their Papers and actings; and why ſhould it be made a matter of challenge againſt him, that he tells not all the truth, ſeeing he had not to do with any more then he tells; his point was to tell, that the perſons under ſcandall, ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the Aſſembly, and not the poſitive qualifications to be required in theſe who are to be admitted to fit a Members. If the Author think that that can contribute any thing either for ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening what the Writer intends to prove, or for clearing of the Commiſſion, he doth well allow it to be told. Thirdly, Theſe words of his, The Writer <hi>magno hiatu</hi> bids any man in the world bring a reaſon: his <hi>magno hiatu</hi> are not words very beſeeming that ſoberneſſe and gravity that becomes a man of his place and parts, he may remember that he uſeth the like expreſsions himſelf; all the world (ſaith he in a certain place of his Vindication ſhall not be able to clear this from uſurpation; and is there not need of as wide a mouth for the one of theſe as for the other. But that which is moſt obſervable, is the ſtrange inference which he drawes from the Writer, citing <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.12. to prove that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon report is made a ground of ſearch: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. to prove that it is made a ground of proceedings, we may ſee by this what

We have given a freſh and recent inſtance to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary what he addeth there, viz. that ſince the late Reformation, there was no cauſe to propone ſuch thing; the Commiſsioners til this year, having carryed themſelves faithfully, we grant the former did carry themſelves faithfully, and that there was no juſt cauſe of proponing that exception againſt the Commiſsion <hi>48;</hi> and we affirm, that the Commiſsion <hi>51,</hi> carryed themſelves faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and that there was no juſt cauſe of proponing that exception againſt them which the Proteſters made, but whether it was ſo or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwayes <hi>in reipſâ</hi> in the very deed it ſelf, ſince both exceptions at the time they were made, were alike to the Aſſembly, and therefore (to borrow the word of the Writer we deſire any man in the world to bring a reaſon why the one Aſſembly ſhould be condemned for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting ſuch an exception before the proceeding of the perſons ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt, were tryed and judged when as the other Aſſembly which rejected the like exception is maintained. But good Reader, look forward upon the Writers following of his Anſwer to the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction mentioned, and ſee a myſtery, and judge thou, if it be not of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity againſt all the late Generall Aſſemblyes of this Kirk; he tells us of an Act made <hi>anno 1601,</hi> and renewed <hi>1648,</hi> and ſayeth, that it doth neceſſarily infer, that the Commiſſioners of a former Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, ſhould not be admitted as Members in the ſucceeding Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, although there be no ſcandall or exception proponed upon their proceedings untill they be tryed, much leſſe when a ſcandall or exception is proponed.

But the truth is, the Writer is ſomewhat raſh in his aſsertion concerning the conſequences of that Act mentioned, look the tenor of it as it is extant in the Aſsembly <hi>48,</hi> Seſs. <hi>6.</hi> It ſayth only this much, That the Commiſſioners of former Aſsemblies ſhall give an accompt of their proceedings in the beginning of the Aſsembly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any other matter or cauſe be handled, and their proceedings to be allowed or diſ-allowed, &amp;c. from which <hi>I</hi> confeſse, this much may be inferred by one ſticking preciſely to the letter of the word, that after the Aſsembly is conſtitute, the handling of all other matters ſhould be ſuſpended, untill the Commiſsioners proceedings ſhould be tryed and put to a point, during which tryal, the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners that are members <hi>vi materiae,</hi> muſt be removed, becauſe the ſame perſons cannot try their own proceedings, but that they may not be admitted in any wayes to be Members of the Aſsembly, not ſo much as to vote in the Election of a Moderator, (which was the thing required by the Proteſters) cannot be inferred from thence, if it were other wayes it ſeems ſtrange to me, that that ſame Aſsem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <hi>48,</hi> which did renew that Act, did at the ſame very time, admit the Commiſsioners of the preceding Aſsembly (ſundry of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Proteſters, and amongſt the reſt, none more then the Writer of this Paper, and the ſuggeſter to him of this conſideration, being chief actors in the buſines) to ſit as Members of the Aſtembly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their proceedings were tryed; yea, and to vote in ſundry other matters during the time of their tryall; and that whenas there was exception made againſt them, but beſide this retortion of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which the Proteſters are obliged to anſwer.</p>

                        <p>ALbeit the Author is pleaſed to ſay, That the Writer ſhall never be able to make good, that the Publick Reſolutions were dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrally oppoſite to clear ſtanding Acts, Remonſtrances, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations of former Aſſemblies, yet he, or ſome others in his room hath often made this good, out of theſe Acts, Remonſtrances, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations, &amp;c. wherein the very contradictory of the Publick Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, is clearly ſet down upon the very circumſtantiat caſe of defending the Cauſe and Countrey againſt forraign Invaſion; and

therfore though there were no more to uphold the Argument but this, the concluſion thereof may ſafely be aſſented to, without any new Edition of the Writers in following his Argument: I am glad that the Author is brought to acknowledg, that all hangs upon this, and doubts that ſome of his friends who quarrell at ſundry former Acts, Remonſtrances and Declarations, as not knowing how to reconcile them with Publick Reſolutions, approve him in this. He would remember, &amp; others would be informed, that in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Meeting at St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> this point was offered to be inſtantly verified out of the Records of the Church under the Clerks hand, who is general<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Firſt, That no like accuſation nor exception came into the Aſſembly 1648, from the very Parliament (or any other) againſt the Members of the Commiſſion who were Commiſſioners to the Aſſembly; neither after a long and ſerious debate was it found (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by our preſent Proteſters or any others) and concluded that none of them could be removed from ſitting in the Aſſembly, and voting in other matters, until their proceedings were firſt heard and tryed. There was in the Aſſembly 1648. no ſuch accuſation nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, nor debate, nor concluſion, which is a ſhort and clear an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for juſtifying that Aſſembly, and for vindicating the truth of that which is alleadged by the Writer in anſwer to the firſt Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to wit, That ſuch exceptions being propounded, were never rejected; and doth withal give a clear reaſon why the one Aſſembly ſhould be condemned, though the other be juſtified; becauſe the one Aſſembly rejected ſo releuant an exception, which the other did not, it being never propounded unto them. In all this buſineſs the Author is greatly miſtaken, and (whether through miſ-informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or how I know not) doth aſſert that for a truth which never had a being, and therefore all his defences built upon it do at one inſtant fall to the ground. The ſtory which as it ſeems he hints at in the 48. was briefly this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In the year 1648. the Aſſembly being

That the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly would be pleaſed to appoint ſome of their number to meet with ſuch as ſhould be appointed by the Committee of Eſtates, for compoſing of miſ-underſtandings betwixt Kirk and State, and for clearing the Marches betwixt the Civil and the Ecleſiaſtick Power, and theſe Queſtions which had been debated betwixt the PAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAMENT and the COMMISSIONERS of the GEN. ASSEMBLY. 2. That they would be pleaſed to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the emitting of any Declaration, either to this Kingdom, or the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> relating to the then Engagement and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. 3. That before the General Aſſembly did proceed to any approbation of the actions of the Commiſſioners of the former Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, that in theſe things which might relate to the then En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, and to theſe Queſtions that had been debated betwixt the Parliament and them, they might be firſt heard. In order to theſe deſires there paſſed ſeveral Papers betwixt the General Aſſembly, and the Committee of Eſtates: But in none of theſe is there any Exception propounded by the Committee of Eſtates againſt any of the Commiſſioners of the former Aſſemblies, nor any deſire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, that they might be removed until theſe Exceptions ſhould be tryed and diſcuſſed: But all the Objections and Exceptions they ſpeak of, is, Objections &amp; Exceptions againſt the proceedings of the Commiſſion in reference to the Engagement, which though they were a good while waited for, and again and again deſired, yet did not the Committee of Eſtates offer one tittle of particular Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Exception againſt the proceedings of the Commiſſion in the matter of the Engagement, before the tryal and approbation of theſe proceedings by the General Aſſembly, much leſs did they offer any Objection or Exception againſt the Members of the Commiſſion,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:166443:100"/>
who were Members of the Aſſembly. The Committee of Eſtates did afterwards print and publiſh very ſharp and reflecting Papers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that Aſſembly, and their Declaration, wherein as was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably conceived, they had the help or ſome very able Miniſters and Lawyers, and yet in all theſe they do not ſo much as once inſinuate any thing of this kind that they did propound ſuch an Exception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Members of the Commiſſion, who were Members of that Aſſembly, which doubtleſs they would not have omitted if any ſuch thing had been: But if the Author will not truſt none of theſe things, which if need were can be atteſted by many who were eye &amp; ear witneſſes therto. To the effect that there be no place for gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying in this matter, I have ſet down after the cloſe of this <hi>Review,</hi> the true Copy of the Papers that paſt betwixt the Committee of Eſtates and the General Aſſembly at that time in that buſineſs, extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted faithfully out of the Regiſters of the Committee of Eſtates; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which no flying report that he hath heard, and taken impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from, can bear any weight. That Myſtery of Iniquity which the Author ſuppoſes to have found againſt all the late Gen. Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of this Church, is but a Myſtery of his own very groundleſs and uncharitable fanſie, wherein he may haply pleaſe himſelf, but brings no edification to his Readers, nor advantage to his Cauſe thereby: It were better for him to be exerciſed in diſcovering true Myſteries of Iniquity, which are nearer home, and as yet a vail to his eyes, then thus to ſtretch his ingyne and ſpend his time to find a knot in a Ruſh. But what is that Myſtery? The Writer tels us, ſaith he of one Act made <hi>anno,</hi> 1601. and renewed <hi>anno,</hi> 1648. and ſaith, That it doth neceſſarily infer, that the Commiſſioners of a former Aſſembly ſhould not be admitted as Members of a ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Aſſembly, though there be no ſcandal nor exception propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon their proceedings until they be tryed; much leſs when a ſcandal or except on is propounded. This ſaith the Author, is a fair blow by one ſtroke given to the late conſtitutions of all the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of this Church <hi>Poſterior</hi> to that Aſſembly at <hi>Glaſgow</hi> without exception, and moſt of all to the Aſſembly 48. for in all of them Commiſſioners of the preceding Aſſemblies reſpective have been admitted to ſit as Members, before their proceeeings were tryed and judged; and in that Aſsembly 1648. they were admitted to ſit, notwithſtanding exceptions being made againſt their ſitting, by the Supream Civil Power of the Land. But if this be candid and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludent
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:166443:101"/>
reaſoning, I deſire leave of him to diſcover another Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Iniquity in his own words, before he cloſe this purpoſe that gives as great a blow to all the late Conſtitutions of all the Aſsem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of this Church ſince the 38. none excepted; his words are theſe, I confeſs that thus much may be inſerted by one ſticking preciſely to the Letter of the Act, That after the Aſſembly is conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, the handling all other matters ſhould be ſuſpended until the Commiſſioners proceedings be tryed and put to a point, during which tryal the Commiſſioners that are Members <hi>vi materiae</hi> muſt be removed; becauſe the ſame perſons cannot try their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. But ſo it is, that though the Letter of the Act and <hi>vis materiae</hi> do infer theſe things, yet after the conſtituting of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, Commiſſioners of all the preceding Aſſemblies reſpective ſince the 38. have been admitted to ſit as Members of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, before the tryal and diſcuſſing of their proceedings: Therfore there is one Myſtery of Iniquity in the Authors words, which pulls down all theſe Aſſemblies of the Church. What Myſtery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity imaginable that reaches unto the pulling down of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies can be found in the Writers words, but this, That theſe Acts 1601. &amp; 1648. do croſs the ordinary practice of all theſe Aſſemblies in this particular, concerning the trying and diſcuſſing of the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Commiſſioners, or that the proceeding of all theſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies in this particular have not been agreable unto, but diſſonant from the Rule holden forth in theſe Acts: And doth not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor yeeld, That both by the Letter of the Act, and <hi>vi materiae,</hi> that they ought to have been removed? But ſo have they not been in any of theſe Aſſemblies before the judging of their proceedings: Doth not then that Myſtery of Iniquity work in him, as well as in the Writer? But he tels us, that it cannot be inferred from thence that they may not be admitted in any waies to be Members of the Aſſembly, not ſo much as to vote in the Election of a Moderator, which was the thing required by the Proteſters (if he had dealt fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he ſhould have ſaid, which is the thing inferred by the Writer; but perhaps he ſaw ſome diſadvantage in that) be it ſo, That that inference cannot be made from thence, yet may this inference well be made from thence, That after the chuſing of the Moderater they cannot be admitted to ſit and vote in any buſineſs in the Aſſembly before their proceedings be allowed or diſallowed, and that if they be admitted before that time, theſe Acts of the Aſſembly are clearly
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:166443:101"/>
croſsed and contradicted, which being done by all theſe Aſsemblies ſince 38. they are to be pulled down as null. When the Author ſhal extricate himſelf and his Readers out of this Myſtery of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he ſhall alſo help the Writer how to clear himſelf of the other. The truth is, though there hath been ſome croſſing between theſe Aſſemblies and the practice of the Aſſembly ſince the 38. both the one way and the other, by the ſitting of the Commiſſioners of the former Aſſembly, not only till the Aſſembly was conſtitute and in the choice of a Moderator, but alſo afterwards in the debating and voting of other buſineſs before the allowing or diſallowing of their proceedings; yet doth not this reach any blow to the conſtitutions of theſe Aſſmblies, becauſe the Act of the Aſſembly 1601. till the year 1648. was almoſt <hi>inter non cognita, &amp; non apparentia</hi>; yea, there was no cauſe to urge it, the Commiſſioners of all theſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies carrying themſelves faithfully, and not being under any ſcandal or any exception therupon proponed againſt them. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit things belonging to former order being propounded and urged (eſpecially in caſes of conſequence upon the matter) cannot be paſt by, unleſs they be formally repealed; yet if through inadvertency or cuſtom they come to be omitted, there being no particular emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent giving occaſion to urge them, yet doth not this give any blow to the Judicatory wherein theſe forms ſhould be uſed; neither doth he, who ſaith, that their own Laws preſcribes ſuch a form, prove guilty of any Myſtery or Iniquity. But the Author inſiſts, That the Aſſembly 48. which did renew that Act, did at the very ſame time admit the Commiſſioners of the preceding Aſſembly, ſundry of the preſent Proteſters, and amongſt the reſt none more then the Writer of this Paper, and the Suggeſter to him of this Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being chief actors in the buſineſs, to ſit as Members of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, before their proceedings were tryed: yea, and to vote in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry other maters during the time of their tryal, and that whereas there was exception made againſt them. I paſs his rubbing upon the Writer of the Paper, and I know not that Suggeſter to him of that conſideration, as being a thing ordinary to him in all this Debate, &amp; yet little either for his own honor, or for the edification of others: I think theſe now are not aſhamed to give their mutual help and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance one to another either by ſuggeſting or digeſting as God hath gifted them, what may contribute for the defence of the Truth. But ſure I am, though he may ſpeak his fanſie, and vent his reflecting
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:166443:102"/>
conjectures that he neither knows who writ the Paper, or if any, or who ſuggeſted that conſideration to him, or what their acting was in that buſineſs in the Aſſembly 48. If he ſhall take into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the circumſtances of proceedings in the Aſſembly 48. which revived the act of the Aſſembly 1601. he will not need to think it ſtrange that they did admit the Commiſsioners of the former Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly to ſit &amp; vote in other matters before their proceedings were tryed and judged, becauſe the motion of reviving that act was not made till a very little time before the report of their proceedings by the Committee of the Aſſembly, to whom the inſpection of the Commiſsion-Book was committed: any who looks upon the acts of the Aſſembly will find, that the act 1601. was revived, and the Commiſsions proceedings approven both in one day, the one in the fore-noon, and the other in the after-noon; and I beleeve that he ſhall not find that in the interval betwixt theſe two Acts, any thing was voted in the Aſſembly. He inſinuates, as if at that time there had been a debate about the removing of the Commiſſioners, upon exception made againſt them; but in this he is miſtaken ſtill: There was no exception made againſt them, nor any debate thereupon, as we have already cleared. If it be asked, what then was the reaſon of reviving the Act 1601. the reaſon was, becauſe the Committee of Eſtates did the day before the report made of the proceedings of the Commiſſion) deſire that the Aſſembly would not proceed to the approbation of theſe proceedings before they might be heard in theſe things that did relate to the Engagement (as we have already ſhown) And the Aſſembly knowing that this was but a ſhift to gain time, and to devide the Aſſembly, as they thought fit to call the Committee, if they had any new Objections againſt the proceedings of the Commiſſion, or only the ſame Objections made by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament or their Committees before; and upon the Reply of the Committee of Eſtates, that they had juſt and material Exceptions, beſides any formerly made, to continue til the next day at 10. hours, and to appoint that time for hearing theſe Exceptions; ſo for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of the like inconveniences for time to come they thought fit to renew the Act 1601. But it wonders me that in all the Authors Anſwer to this point, he doth not ſo much as once touch upon the parity of the reaſon brought by the Writer for making of the Act in the Aſſembly 1601. and urging it in the Aſſembly 1651. there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in both theſe Aſſemblies a ſcandal of defection upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:166443:102"/>
of the Kirk; upon the firſt, for taking upon them to give in Petitions to the Parl. for votes in Parlament to the Miniſters that ſhould be provided to Presbyteries, as repreſenting the true Church of God, and being the Third Eſtate of the Realm; upon the latter, for taking upon them to bring in the Malignant party, which did not fal out (nor the like in any of the Aſſemblies ſince the 38.) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no reaſon to queſtion the Conſtitution of theſe Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, for not proceeding according to that Rule, it neither being urged, nor there being any cauſe to urge the ſame.</p>

                     <p>IN the next place to come to a more direct Anſwer: It is certain, That every propounding of Exceptions or Alleadgance of ſcandals againſt perſons, and offering to prove them, is not ſufficient to deprive them from being Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of, or ſitting in the General Aſſembly: for were it ſo, perverſe and bold men might return and diſappoint the Church of all Gen.

If he ſay it would, then ſay I, it would alſo have been relevant, though it had not been proponed untill the Aſſembly, and if it be denyed? I would know the reaſon of the difference, if he ſay it would not have been relevant, then I deſire it to be conſidered, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the offer of ſome perſons undertaking inſtantly to verifie what they do alleadge; be not of as great weight as ſome preſumptions of the fact, let be a ſcandall of ſome preſumptions of the fact, which is granted by the Author to be ſufficient, if the matter be relevant in Law: But granting this, he cannot ſee but ſtill the abuſed conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence

Upon ſuppoſall that there were ſome occaſion given hereby to fear ſuch a thing, yet if another as evill a conſequence do more probably follow upon denying this: That is remeadileſs corrupting of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies in their conſtitution; what ſhall be done in that caſe? That this conſequence will follow, eſpecially where the exceptions do concern many, and leading menare, is of a more common and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall influence, appears, becauſe if theſe perſons be admitted to ſit as members after the proponing of theſe exceptions, before tryall of them, there can be no regreſs to the removing of them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards upon that ground, unleſs we ſay that the Aſsembly may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards undoe that which formerly they did approve, in <hi>for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When did it ever fall out in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that a Generall Aſſembly was diſappointed by perverſe and bold men, offering to prove exceptions relevant in Law, but fals in fact againſt the conſtituent members thereof? who can give any inſtance thereof, unleſs men will bring the Aſsembly 51. (which is to bring the thing in queſtion) for an inſtance: But upon the other hand, the admitting of men to ſit againſt whom ſuch exceptions were, or might have been proponed, hath been one of the main cauſes of corruptions of Aſsemblies, and defection in this Church, as is known in the time of the Prelates, and it is the duty of wiſe men to provide moſt againſt that which <hi>ut plurimum</hi> is their danger: But as I do not ſee how the laſt conſequence by the Authors way, can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, ſo I do not ſee how the firſt conſequence doth follow, becauſe theſe perverſe &amp; bold perſons who propones the exceptions, &amp; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to verifie them inſtantly, doth not ſuppoſe that all the Meeting to whom they offer the exceptions are guilty; for if they did ſuppoſe that they could not propone any exceptions to be tryed by them, but behoved <hi>primo inſtanti</hi> to decline them all as judges, reſerving
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:166443:104"/>
the verification of their alleadgances to a judge competent. Now if they do thus, the Aſsembly is not diſappointed by perverſe and bold perſons, offering to verifie exceptions, becauſe in this caſe they do not make any offer of verification of any exception, before that Meeting; upon the other hand, if they do acknowledge a part of them as perſons competent, and fitly qualified to try and diſcuſs theſe exceptions which they offer to verifie, then the perſons againſt whom they except being removed, and the exceptions taken in, and cognoſced upon, according to the verification offered, they are found either true or falſe; if they be found falſe, the Aſſembly is not diſappointed, but may proceed to its Conſtitution, having found their members blameleſſe, and having ſtopped theſe mens mouths. If the exceptions be found true of ſuch a number, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whom the reſt cannot make an Aſſembly, there is a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in ſtead of a feared diſadvantage, that is the prevention of a corrupt Meeting, conſtituting themſelves in an Aſſembly; if but a fewer number, the corrupt are removed, and the blameleſſe are admitted, and the Aſſembly goes on: Beſides all this, it may by way of Commiſſion, without any diſadvantage to the Proteſters cauſe be yeelded to the Author; that it is to be looked to that the Perſons offering to verifie theſe exceptions be not perverſe perſons, but men of a good report, and ſuch as are known to walk honeſtly, and not to act upon a Principle of malice or il-will againſt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whom the exceptions do concern, all which was true in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſters caſ<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

There might have been and was indeed by ſome ſpread a flagrant ſcandall, but there was no flagrant ſcandall (theſe ſame who afterwards accuſed them in the Aſſembly) I mean preſumptions objective by any thing they did though there was preſumptions enough in ſome men againſt them, and as for ſome perſons offering to inſtruct it, that is to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to argue them ſcandallous, but the great ſophiſm in this whole diſcourſe (whereinto I will not determine, whether out of inanim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertency or willingly the Writer hath run) lyeth in this, that

                        <p>I Shal paſs the Authors interludes, of the Writers believing that he hath cleared as with a Sun beam, and gained his point; and of that he doubts not but that the Writer and ſome others did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to challenge for more; and that there was a flagrant ſlander ſpread by ſome; and that there was preſumption enough in ſome men; and come unto the diſcuſſing of that Sophiſme (as he is pleaſed to call it) whereinto he will not determine, whether out of inanimadvertencie or willingly the Writer (as he alleadges) hath run. But let us hear what this Sophiſme is; The main and principal queſtion <hi>de jure</hi> (which ſhould have been cleared (ſaith he) to the effect that ſcandal might have been juſtly charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Commiſſioners, was not the Generall or <hi>Theſis</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther betraying of truſt, and making defection from the Covenant, &amp;c. be ſuch a fault as deſerves excluſion from ſitting as a Member in a Generall Aſſembly; but this particular <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> whether the reſolving that all perſons, excepting ſuch as are notoriouſly prophane, &amp;c. may be admitted to joyn in Arms for juſt and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary defence of the Kingdom, when otherwiſe there cannot be Forces had in warrantable prudence, ſufficient for the defence of it, &amp;c. If the right ſtating of the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> were the thing now directly in queſtion, it were needfull to conſider more largely of the Authors ſtating of it; but becauſe it comes in on the by, I ſhall onely deſire theſe few things to be taken notice of in the ſtate of the queſtion which he gives; firſt, That it doth ſuppoſe ſomething untrue, to wit, That Forces (in warrantable prudence) ſufficient for defence of the Kingdom, could not otherwiſe be had, unleſſe all perſons in the Land (excepting theſe included in the excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſet down in the anſwer to the Quaere) were brought forth.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:166443:106"/>
If we may ſuppoſe, that Forces equall in number to thoſe who were invading the Land, were Forces ſufficient in warrantable prudence to defend the Land, that number, yea the double of it were to be found be North <hi>Forth,</hi> (to ſpeak nothing of other parts in the Land, out of which there were alſo Leavies made both of Horſe and Foot) though all the perſons in queſtion for their Malignancie and diſ-affection to the Cauſe, had been laid aſide. The Forces which by theſe Reſolutions was leavied, were by the acknowledgment of all who knew both the Armies as numerous, if not more numerous than the Forces of the Adverſaries, and yet the Leavies in many places was but the fourth Fenſible man, and in few or no places beyond the third; whence it will follow, that either the two part of the perſons in theſe places where the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies were made, were ſuch as did fall within the exceptions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Commiſſions Anſwer to the Quaere, or elſe that there was no ſuch neceſſity of an univerſall coming forth, as was allowed in that Anſwer, and that therefore the neceſsity that was alleadged for imploying of theſe men who were formerly exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, was but meerly pretended. Secondly, That there were no ſuch Items (as he adds) in the Commiſsions anſwer to the Quaere, which was the foundation of the Publick Reſolutions, and the main thing in debate betwixt the Commiſsion and the oppoſites of theſe Publick Reſolutions; The firſt Item reſolving, that the time of Civill cenſures inflicted by the Parliament upon perſons acceſſorie to former Malignant courſes, as the ſinfull Engagement might be diſpenſed with and taken off by the Parliament, with this proviſion, That none ſhould be admitted to places of power and truſt but ſuch as are qualified poſitively according to the rule of the Word of God in that caſe holden forth in our Solemn En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, (To paſſe by the way of carrying of it, which was palpable and obvious to the whole Land) was not added until the Forces were almoſt compleatly leavied, and the bulk of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Party brought into employment, and places of power and truſt in the Army. The ſecond Item, ordaining Presbyteries to proceed with perſons formerly guilty of malignant courſes, for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion of them into Publick repentance, in a way conform to the rules ſet down by the Generall Aſſembly, for admitting ſuch upon teſtimonies from Presbyteries, bearing ſatisfaction given by then, conform to theſe rules, was not at all included in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsions
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:166443:107"/>
anſwer, neither was there ſo much of it as one word in that large Warning of the 7. of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1651. emitted by the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for ſtrengthening of that Anſwer, and when anything of that kind in latter Warnings, Acts and Letters came to be added, was alwayes holden forth but as expedient, in order to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying of theſe men, but never was preſſed in any of theſe Papers as a neceſſary duty to exclude all theſe from being employed for defence of the Cauſe and Kingdom, who did not give evidence of their repentance, according to the Acts of the Generall Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; nay, it could not be ſo preſſed, unleſſe they had deſtroyed the foundation which they had laid in their anſwer to the Quaere, and in that Warning. The truth is, what was done in the matter of repentance, in order to the employing theſe men, was upon the ſtumbling and out-crying of many againſt the Publick Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as they came firſt forth, and yet ſo as the firſt ground was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes holden faſt as to the matter of judgment; and for practice, the buſineſſe was hereby rather made worſe before the Lord, and to the point of guiltineſſe, then it was before; The Commiſsion not only ranverſing former Acts made by themſelves for exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding theſe from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper who were in the rebellion after <hi>Dumbar,</hi> till the next Generall Aſſembly, and making new Acts for receiving of them; but receiving promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly ſuch as came unto them, and by their example teaching Presbyteries to do the like, by which was produced a fearfull mocking of the Ordinance of God in publick Repentance, which no doubt hath been one of the provoking cauſes of the Lords wrath, to draw on theſe dreadfull ſtroaks wherewith he hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſmitten our Armies and our whole Land. But to the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis it ſelf, granting to the Author that which he alleadges, that this hypotheſis was not clear at the time of the Proteſtation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as yet there was not any particular determination therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in former Generall Aſſemblies. Firſt, I doubt of that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of his, That when an imputation of ſcandall depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a particular hypotheſis which at leaſt is queſtionable, and the very point in controverſie betwixt them and their accuſers, it is againſt all reaſon and equity, that they ſhould be holden to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a preſumption of ſcandall, untill that particular hypotheſis be diſcuſſed and cleared, and therefore untill that be done, the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries alleadgeance againſt them, is to be held but as a meer al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadgeance,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:166443:107"/>
upon which they are not to be excluded from ſitting as Members in the Aſsembly, until their cauſe be judged and tryed. I ſuppoſe that ſome Commiſſioners to the Aſsembly ſhould object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt other Commiſsioners that had comitted murder, and ſhould offer inſtantly to verifie the ſame, and deſire that the perſons againſt whom it is propounded ſhould be removed from ſitting as Members until it migbt be tryed; and they in the mean time ſhould ſay, that it was true, they had taken the life of ſuch perſons, but in their own juſt and neceſſary defence, and therefore they could not be holden under a ſcandal of murder, nor be thereupon removed from ſitting in the Aſſembly, till that particular Hypotheſis were firſt determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: Would the Author think it a wrong done to theſe perſons, or rather a duty in reference to the conſtitution of the Aſsembly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>l the matter ſhould be cognoſced upon? 2. I do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, That not only former Aſsemblies, but the Aſsembly 1651. did remove Commiſsioners upon Exceptions propounded againſt them, the grounds wherof was not yet clearly determined in Law; for inſtance, The Commiſsioners of the firſt Election of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie of GLASGOVV, who were laid aſide (as for other Reaſons, ſo alſo for this as one, <hi>in foro controdicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio,</hi> ſuſtained to be relevant) becauſe of the Exception of the oppoſing of Publick Reſolutions propounded againſt them. Next, Mr. <hi>Robert Cauden</hi> Commiſſioner from the Presbytery of <hi>Dunce,</hi> was removed upon the propounding of this exception, that there were but three or four Miniſters in that Presbyterie to chuſe Commiſſioners, all the reſt of the Churches thereof being vacant; and can any Determination of this Kirk be produced, that three or four Miniſters in a Presbytery, where the reſt of the Churches of that Presbytery are vacant, cannot chuſe Commiſſioners to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſembly. 3. I do upon the ground which the Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf laies down, prove the carriage of the Commiſſioners to have been ſcandalous, and ſuch as did miniſter juſt ground of excepting againſt them, why they ſhould not ſit as Members in the Generall Aſſembly, till their carriage ſhould be firſt tried: my Argument is this, Whoſoever Commiſſioners of the General Aſſembly being in their truſt and carriage in the Publick Affairs of the Kirk limited and tyed to proceed according to Acts of former General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, does upon the accompt of the diſcharge of their truſt, declare many godly Miniſters in the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> (till then of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:166443:108"/>
integrity and faithfulneſs in the work of GOD) to be Malignants and unfaithful in the cauſe, &amp;c. and requires Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to cenſure them, and to refer and cite them to the General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, becauſe of their oppoſing of Reſolutions taken and iſſued by them, concerning which there is no particular Determination in any former Aſſembly: They give ſcandal and offence in the diſcharge of their truſt, and may juſtly becauſe thereof be excepted againſt, as not fit to ſit in the General Aſſembly as Members thereof, before their carriage be tryed: But the Commiſſioners of the Aſſembly 1651. who were Members of the Commiſſion, were ſuch; <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> The aſſumption is clear, the matters of fact contained therein being evident from their own Papers, and that they were not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by any Act of the Aſſembly ſo to do; is the Authors own ground. The firſt Propoſition I prove thus: Whoſoever ſo far tranſgreſſes the bounds of their Commiſſion, as upon the accompt thereof, to declare many formerly faithful, to be Malignants, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful, and ordains them to be cenſured and cited, when they have no warrant thereby ſo to do, gives ſcandal and offence in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their truſt: But the Commiſsioners by ſo doing did ſo far tranſgreſs the bounds of their Commiſsion, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo</hi> what the Author will here anſwer I do not well know; But I would faine have him to tel a reaſon why the Commiſsion dealt ſo ſharply with many godly men, as to iſſue ſuch Declarations and Warnings againſt them, and to appoint them to be cenſured and cited, and to ſtir up the Civil Magiſtrate againſt them, becauſe of their oppoſing of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Reſolutions; whileſt, by his own acknowledgment, there was, as yet, no determination of the Church in favours of theſe Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or againſt the oppoſers of them: I thought it had been his mind that the Commiſsion could not cenſure any, or ordain any to be cenſured for oppoſing Reſolutions of their own, not yet deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined nor approven in a General Aſſembly; and I would have him to give a reaſon, why he accompts it againſt all equity that when the imputation of ſcandal againſt the Commiſsioners depends upon a particular hypotheſis, which at leaſt is queſtionable, and the very point of controverſie betwixt them and their accuſers (as he calls them, though unjuſtly, becauſe they, as Members of the Aſſemblie, were doing of that duty which is common and competent to every Member of the Aſſembly, that is, to object what they know of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal againſt any other Member, that the Aſſembly might be conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted

of perſons rightly qualified) they ſhould be holden to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a preſumption of ſcandal until that hypotheſis be diſcuſſed and cleared, and why it ſhould be agreeable to equity and reaſon, that upon ſuch a particular hypotheſis, which at the leaſt is queſtionable, and the very point in controverſie betwixt the Commiſsion, and many faithful men, and ſome Synods, and not a few Presbyteries in the Land, ſhould be holden not only to be under a preſumption of ſcandal, but alſo ſuch as did deſerve to be publickly declared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt as Malignant and unfaithful, and appointed to be cenſured and cited: It ſeems that whilſt the Author reaſons thus about his hypotheſis, that what he gains one way he loſeth another. I ſee not how by his queſtionable hypotheſis he can defend the equity of the Commiſſions proceedings in their Warnings, Remonſtrances, and Acts againſt theſe who were unſatisfied with, and did oppoſe the Publick Reſolutions; and when he ſhall do it, I hope his own grounds ſhall help the Proteſters to prove the equity and reaſon of removing Commiſſioners, even upon ſuppoſal that it was but a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable hypotheſis. 4. I deſire to know of the Author, by what power, or in what capacity the Commiſſion did look upon them, to determine this queſtionable hypotheſis: as a Commiſſion they could not do it, becauſe there is no clauſe in their Commiſſion that gives them power or warrant to determine any point of Doctrine not formerly determined by the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi>; but their Commiſſion ties them in all things to walk according to former De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations, Acts and Conſtitutions of General Aſſemblies; and I think he will not ſay that by vertue of any other power or capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they either did it, or could do it. The Author hath by his own confeſſion and ground, brought the Commiſſion a greater length in the exerciſe of their power, then ever the Gen. Aſſembly did give to them, or (for any thing I know) did mean to give unto them, that is, To determine points of Doctrine of great importance and conſequence; as to the ſecurity of Religion, and of the Cauſe and Covenant, not formerly determined by this Church in any of her Gen. Aſſemblies, &amp; upon theſe Determinations to declare ſuch as are unſatisfied with, and do oppoſe the ſame, not only to be cenſurable, but alſo appoint them to be cenſured: I thought if any thing had been the proper work of a Gen. Aſſembly this had been it. But more directly to the point: I do affirm that this Hypotheſis, the Publick Reſolutions determined by the Commiſſion of the General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

Theſe were the things which the Proteſters alleadged and offered to verifie, not only the general, that the Commiſsioners had made defection from the Cauſe and Covenant; but that theſe particular Reſolutions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded and carried on by them, did involve a defection from the Cauſe and Covenant; this (I ſay) they offered to inſtruct from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Acts of Aſsemblies ſpeaking clearly and poſitively there anent; which yet were refuſed to be heard by the Meeting until they firſt ſhould conſtitute themſelves in an Aſsembly including theſe Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, againſt which the Exception was propounded, a greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation upon their freedom then they will eaſily wipe off.</p>

in that Judicatory as Members, I ſuppoſe was cleer, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants brought many plauſible Preſumptions that they were guilty of it more plauſible a great deal then this Writer al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadges againſt the late Commiſsioners, they bring Particular inſtances of Facts, as keeping ſeparated Congregations and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries from the Remonſtrant refuſing to joyn in Prayers or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments with them: whereas our Writer alleadges nothing but Generals, offence of many godly, pregnant preſumptions, men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking to inſtruct, &amp;c. But here was a Queſtion in <hi>Hypotheſi,</hi> Whether it be a ſchiſm to keep ſeparated Congregations and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytries from, and to refuſe to joyn in Prayers and Sacraments with men that had departed in their doctrin from ſuch and ſuch Articles of the Doctrin of that Reformed Kirk as the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants had done? And therefore theſe Miniſters accuſed by them, could not be held as under ſcandal of Schiſm, or Preſumption thereof, until the Points in Controverſie were tryed, Whether the Remonſtrants Tenents were Erroneous, and of what conſequence and importance they were; and until then, the Remonſtrants Challenge of Schiſm againſt them could not be reputed but a meer Alleadgance. I know other things were Anſwered to this Reaſon of that Proteſtation by the forrain Divines from the Members themſelves in Controverſie betwixt the one and the other; but it may be evidently perceived in ſundry of their judgments upon that Proteſtation that they had all one Eye to this that we have ſaid.

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:166443:110"/>
decline to be judged in theſe things by the Acts thereof, as not being quadrant to their caſe: So do they cry out upon the oppoſers of Publick Reſolutions, for citing theſe Acts ſo often againſt them, and for inſiſting ſo little upon the Word of God, which they call for as the onely rule whereby they will be judged in theſe things, to be determined by former Aſſemblies, ſo were they moſt willing and deſirous, that they and the Commiſſioners in their judgments and actings upon theſe things, ſhould be judged thereby. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The Remonſtrants did accuſe the Anti-Remonſtrants of Schiſme, and as Schiſmaticks moſt unjuſtly, of which we ſhall give the reaſon in the words of the Brittain Divines then in the Synod; <hi>Quia ipſi remonſtrantes recedendo à doctrina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cemmuniter recepta, initium &amp; cauſatio hujus ſeparationis exti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terum, nam veritas habetur, quod â primordio in Eccleſiâ aliquâ traditum &amp; receptum fuerit, erpor reputatur quod poſtea induci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, donec habito legitimo examine &amp; Judicio contrarium conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datur, quo etiam accedit quod illi dici non poſſunt a doctrinâ Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrantium receſſiſſe (quod in ſchiſmate praeſupponendum est) qui illam nunquam receperint ſed ab initio ſibi propoſitam rejece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint &amp; condemnârint,</hi> (words worthy of obſervation in order to the whole debate upon the Publick Reſolutions) but theſe who did except againſt the ſitting of the Commiſſioners in the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Aſſembly, upon their making defection from the Cauſe and Covenant, did it juſtly, becauſe of their departing from the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Doctrine of this Church, and the bringing in of new and ſtrange Doctrine in that point which the other offered to verifie. Thirdly, The thing which the Remonſtrants did deſire, was, That the Anti-Remonſtrants ſhould be removed wholly out of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, and be ſet to the Bar to anſwer as guilty of Schiſme, and as Parties againſt the Remonſtrants in this buſineſs; and hence are theſe ſentencet of the <hi>Britain</hi> and of the other Divines which are cited by the Author, But the thing deſired by theſe who excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt the Commiſsioners, was not that they ſhould be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved wholly from the Aſſembly, or holden as guilty before tryall, but that their ſitting in the Aſſembly might be ſuſpended untill it were tryed whether they were guilty, yea or not, and therefore the Author in citing and expounding theſe ſentences as he doth, hath not onely done wrong to the Proteſters, but alſo to the conſtant received Order of this Church in the conſtitution of her Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:166443:111"/>
becauſe if theſe ſentences be exponed not onely againſt the removing wholly out of the Aſſembly, but alſo againſt the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of them for a time till they be tryed, then have all the Aſsem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of this Church followed a wrong method, who did ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily upon exceptions proponed, remove ſundry of their number, though they were not as yet <hi>convicti</hi> nor <hi>condemnati</hi>; and though they did ſuſpend their ſentence about removing of them wholly, yet did they not ſuſpend their ſentence about removing them for a time, untill the exception ſhould be tryed, this being the very way eſtabliſhed, and conſtantly followed in all the free and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Aſſemblies of this Kirk for keeping of her Aſsemblies pure. If the Author will not admit of the removing of any till he be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict, and will have thoſe Divines at <hi>Dort</hi> ſo to be exponed, then let him tell us how he will reconcile them and our Church in this particular; But it is eaſie by the anſwer which we have given, ſo to do; yea, it is manifeſt from the whole ſcope of the buſineſs at <hi>Dort,</hi> that theſe Divines ſpeak in order to a totall removall, which was never deſired by the Proteſters in reference to the Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners. But let us turn the Schene a little, and ſuppoſe that the <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches had choſen and ſent to the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> the Remonſtrants as their Commiſsioners, and that the Anti-Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants had been cited before the Synod, and had proponed as an exception againſt the Remonſtrants ſitting in the Synod, that they were under a ſcandall of erroneous and corrupt doctrine, which they did offer inſtanily to prove by comparing their Doctrine with the Doctrine of the <hi>Belgick</hi> and Reformed Churches in their Confeſsions and Catechiſmes, and thereupon deſired that they might be removed from ſitting as Members in the Synod, untill this exception were tryed: Doth the Author think that the reſt of the Synod, would or could in reaſon have refuſed to grant this deſire. From all theſe things I hope it doth appear, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of any thing anſwered by the Author, it is a relevant exception againſt the freedome and right conſtitution of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, that they did before trying of the Commiſsioners procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings admit them to ſit as Members of the Aſsembly, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the exception of ſcandall upon them timeouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned and offered to be inſtructed. As for that which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſaith of the Proteſters ſuffering Mr. <hi>Andrew Cant</hi> with good liking of all of them ſo far as could be perceived, to put Mr. <hi>Robert

                        <p>THe Author doth handſomely wave many things in the Writers Paper that are of importance, and I think his Readers will do him no wrong to take for granted in that Paper, what he doth not anſwer nor contradict: What is there ſet down clearly and at large by the writer out of the Acts of the Gen. Aſſembly, he turns off with a few words. 1. He tels us it had been good that the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

But are not the citations for the matter clear and home to the point? If the Author think there is wrong done in any of them; I believe if he will call to the Clerk of the Aſſembly, he may yet find the means to get him the double of the very words of the Acts aſſerted under his hand; It is true that every one is not a keeper of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters, nor hath Copies of them beſides us: But ſhall they not therefore be truſted who are keepers of them? or have Copies; It had been belike good for the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that the Author &amp; ſome others who have been ſo actively inſtrumental for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Reſolutions had been keepers of the Regi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It muſt be of diligent enquiry, for ſo it is expreſſed there, Chapter 17. v. 4. and 19.18. which
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:166443:114"/>
imports that it ſhould be an enquiry without delay, but this was refuſed about the preſent caſe in queſtion, and notwithſtanding of this common report, and objecting the ſcandall thereof in the Aſſembly, the enquiry was delayed untill the Aſſembly was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute, and no more diligence was uſed in it, then if there had been no ſuch report at all; he doth injury to the Writer, by labouring to bear upon him, and upon others, that he is of that minde, that the Commiſſion upon that common report which he alleadges to have been paſſing upon them, ſhould have been without more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe ſentenced to cenſure. The utmoſt that the Writer all along hath pleaded in this hath been, that the Commiſſioners ought to have been removed till their carriage were tryed: But two grounds he layes to prove this to have been the Writers minde: 1. That the Proceeding ordered, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5. was in order to preſent cenſure, 2. That he alleadgeth the Apoſtles words ſo generall, without any qualification, I ſhall not ſtand upon the firſt, but the Writer not being upon the handling of that point, what common report, or how qualified, was needfull to be a ground of ſentence, but onely ſhewing that ſometimes common report may be ſo; he thought it enough to cite the Apoſtles words without qualifying of them, and if the Author will make this a ground of challenge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Writer, he may make it againſt the Apoſtle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for he ſets down the words generally, without any ſuch qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification, and the Writer doth not extend them to any other caſe then that of which the Apoſtle is treating: He only ſaith that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon report is made a ground of proceeding againſt the inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian,</hi> without making any application of it to the Commiſſions caſe, or ſaying that it ſhould alſo be a ground of proceeding againſt them; if it be asked to what purpoſe then it was cited, the anſwer is very obvious and clear from the whole drift of the Writers diſcourſe, which is to ſhew that the perſons objected againſt, were under a ſcandall, and this he doth: 1. By ſhewing that there was a hear-ſay and common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of it, upon which the Scriptures layes ſo much weight, as ſometimes to make it a ground of tryall: As <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. Sometimes a ground of proceeding, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. It is true that the Scriptures doth not make every hear-ſay and common report a ground to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt men under a ſcandall, or to proceed againſt them, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe honeſt men indeed might be in an ill condition, but the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:166443:114"/>
of theſe things are to be drawn from the circumſtances of the facts whereunto they are applyed, and of theſe we have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the fact of the Commiſſioners, and therefore the Author in this particular doth but trouble himſelf and others without cauſe, yet muſt I ſay, that though for any thing I know or can be collected from the writers words, the utmoſt that he pleads for being a delay of their admiſſion to be members of the Aſſembly, which could not be accompted a ſentence againſt them, more than againſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who were delayed upon exceptions to be admitted, that his meaning was not, That the common report that paſt upon the Commiſſioners, was ſufficient to be a ground of preſent ſentence againſt them, yet when the Author hath ſtreached himſelf to the utmoſt, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That he makes them to have ſtumbled without a cauſe, whereas there was very reall cauſes of ſtumbling given unto them, both in regard of that which was done, and for the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:166443:115"/>
maner of doing. That which was done was, employing of the whole Body of the Land promiſcuouſly (a very few perſons being excepted) amongſt whom were many Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and diſ-affected men, who had been formerly exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and with whom the Lords people in the Land had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the Word of God, and from the conſtant tenour of the doctrine of all the faithfull Miniſters of this Church, to keep a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance as to imploying them in the defence of the Cauſe and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; As this was a main occaſion of contriving the League and Covenant, ſo is there a ſpeciall Article therein relating thereto; the breach whereof was one of the ſpeciall and main ſins confeſt in the Solemn acknowledgment of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                           </gap>, and the contrary duty, one of the main things to which we engage our ſelvs in our ſolemn En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement. It is true, that the Commiſsion having done this, &amp; find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many to ſtumble, did afterwards finde out ſome evaſions and diſtinctions to ſave their own credit: but the contradiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their reſolutions and former principles &amp; proceedings, was <hi>primâ fronte</hi> ſo palpable and obvious, that men of all ſorts, both well-affected and ill-affected, did ſee it ſo, as the one did rejoyce, and the other mourn; the Godly did not more ſtumble then the Malignant and prophane were glad, and both the one and the other as to the generality of them, did then, and do at this day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in this, That the publick Reſolutions are not agreeable to former principles and proceedings. There was cauſe of ſtumbling given alſo to the Godly in regard of the Commiſſioners their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of proceeding, becauſe a Quorum very few moe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion did lay the foundation of theſe reſolutions, not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the reſt of their number, but alſo without advertiſing a great many of them: And ſo many being abſent and not adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they did in a day or two determine that moſt grave caſe, which had often before that time been determined in the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and ſent abroad their Determinations to Presbyteries, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring obedience, and upon mens offering the grounds of their diſ-ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and profeſsing their adherence thereto, till ſatisfaction ſhould be given, did iſſue ſuch Warnings and Acts as we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſpoken of. I appeal the Author himſelf, whether at the time of the giving of the Anſwer to the Quaere, it was not known to the Commiſsion, that many godly and faithfull Miniſters and Profeſſors in the Land, were averſe from employing theſe men in
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:166443:115"/>
the Army, and had great ſcruples about it; and that many Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Commiſſion, who were not to be deſpiſed, had often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt their diſlike of it; albeit the matter had been lawful, ſurely there was great precipitancy and raſhneſs in the firſt Reſolution, which is acknowledged by ſober men, even of the ſame judgment; but ſuch was the zeal and forwardneſs of the Court, and of ſome Parliament men on the one hand, and the readineſs of ſundry of the Commiſſion (who had before that time declared themſelves for that way) on the other hand to hearken unto them, and the faintneſs of any that were preſent to oppoſe it, that hold was taken of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to do it <hi>quovis modo,</hi> whereby real offence was given to the godly in the Land; <hi>Si quid importuna levitate, aut laſcivia, aut temeritate non ordine nec ſuo loco facias quo imperiti imbecilles<expan>

Next he doth a wrong in making them ſo ignorant, ſimple and facile as in theſe things to be led away, with the miſ-repreſentations and miſ-informations of others: Many of the moſt judicious decerning Chriſtians in the Land were ſtumbled at the Commiſſions proceedings, upon the firſt hearing of them; &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Proteſters did make either right or wrong Repreſentations of them: I will not ſay but they were confirmed in the diſlike of theſe proceedings, by conference with the Proteſters &amp; other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of that judgment, as they alſo were mutually edified and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by them, but that all the ſtumbling and diſlike did ariſe from the ſuggeſtions and practiſings of ſome or all of the ſame perſons, whom the Author calls the Alleadgers and Accuſers, is not true; yea, I dare ſay, that albeit all the Proteſters, and all the Miniſters in <hi>Scotland</hi> had been of one mind with the Commiſſion in the matter the Publick Reſolutions, yet many of the godly in <hi>Scotland</hi> would have ſtumbled thereat: It would have been in this caſe as in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the Treaty, wherwith many of the godly in <hi>Scotland</hi> were diſſatisfied, notwithſtanding that there ſeemed to be a harmony and conſent amongſt the Miniſtry there anent. That there were more Teſtimonies for the Commiſſioners from Presbeteries and Synods then were againſt them is no great wonder; multitudes commonly inclining to the worſt ſide in the day of tentation, and they being
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:166443:116"/>
but few who keep their garments pure: yet did not the ſtrength of the Teſtimonies upon the one hand or on the other ly in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Witneſses, but upon the truth and clearneſs of their Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: what was teſtified by the oppoſers of the Commiſſion was confirmed by clear Evidence from the conſtant Doctrine of this Church grounded upon the Word of God, and ſet down in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and Solemn Acknowledgment of Sins, and Engagement to Duties, and Publick Warnings, Declarations, Remonſtrances, &amp;c. but not ſo much as a tittle of theſe for Evidence on the other ſide. It is acknowledged by the Author himſelf, That the Publick Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions was a caſe not formerly determined by any Publick Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Kirk, and if ſo there could no evidence be brought from the Doctrine of this Church for clearing and confirming of theſe Reſolutions. The Author is pleaſed to call the Teſtimonies given againſt the Publick Reſolutions, really and in themſelves Scandals, tending moſt evidently to the expoſing of the Kingdom and of the Cauſe to the power of the Invaders: He was pleaſed a little above to call them Slanders, and ſo all the godly in <hi>Scotland</hi> who ſpeak againſt theſe Reſolutions are upon his accompt Slanderers. But theſe Teſtimonies, were neither Slanders, nor Scandals, they did contain real Truths, and were Duties to which the givers of them were obliged in a backſliding time for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering of their own ſouls, and preſerving the Cauſe of God from being overborn with a ſpate of defection; and though in many things they acknowledge themſelves to be amongſt the moſt ſinful, yet in this they were ſo far from expoſing of the Kingdom &amp; Cauſe to the power of the Invaders, that they hold themſelves bound to bleſs the Lord while they live who gave them mercy to be kept free from that carnal ſinful courſe that did provoke the Lord to give ſo great a ſtroak to the Kingdom and the Cauſe, in thoſe dreadful Rods wherewith he hath ſmitten us ſince theſe Reſolutions. What was the ſenſe that the Invaders themſelves had of this, I do not well know, but this it's like enough they rejoyced in our Diviſions: But it was not the oppoſing of the Publick Reſolutions wherein they did directly rejoyce: Nothing from us-ward would have been matter of ſo great terror to them, as to have ſeen us unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in ſeparating from, and oppoſing of all Malignant Intereſts: As it was upon the other hand, the matter of their confidence and joy, that their former quarrel ſeemed to be juſtified by the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:166443:116"/>
Reſolutions, which did ſo much ſtrengthen and promove Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Intereſts, if we may beleeve their own Expreſſions and Letters, written from ſome of the Chief of them to the Higher Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers in <hi>England.</hi> He tels us, That for that cauſe ſome of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies were ſooner put into their hands, then communicated to the Commiſsioners; and they in thankfulneſs were very thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, to cauſe print them. This is a crimination of no ſmal conſequence to the Name and Fame of theſe of whom the Author ſpeaks; and therfore if he had dealt candidly and ſpoken truth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on perſwaſion and evidence, he ſhould have told us of what Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies he meaned, and who it was that put them into their hands, that theſe men might have been noted &amp; known. I doubt not but if he could have done it, he would have done it, ſeeing he ſpares not to put Imputations upon men by Name and Sirname, when he conceives himſelf to have any ground for it, and that it will bring any advantage to his cauſe. But whileſt he would fain render ſome of the oppoſers of the Publick Reſolutions, odious, and yet hath not ground upon which he can confidently do it: He ſpeaks ſo indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly ſome of the Teſtimonies were put &amp;c. neither telling us what Teſtimonies, nor by whom they were put in their hands, that if he be challenged for it, he may have a ſhift to make his retreit. But I doubt that this way of defaming his neighbors will be found ſtraight before God. If I may conjecture of what Teſtimonies he ſpeaks, it ſeems to be the Letter of the Presbytery of <hi>Sterling,</hi> for that, ſo far as I know, was the only Teſtimony printed by the <hi>Engliſh</hi>; and if he mean of that, he ſpeaks untruly, when he ſaith, that it was ſooner put into their hands, then ſent unto the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; I can confidently aſſure him, and all others, that it was ſent unto the Commiſſioners, before any copy of it was given, or ſent to any who were not Members of the Presbytery; and I can as confidently ſay, That none of theſe had any hand directly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly in conveying that Letter to the <hi>Engliſh</hi>: The man amongſt them who was moſt ſlandered hath given me warrant to ſay, (and I truſt that he will abide by it) That his conſcience doth bear him record, that he was inocent of that, as of all things of that kind; and that to this day he knows not how that Letter was put into their hands, unleſs it was by occaſion of intercepting the Copie thereof by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> with Mr. <hi>Andrew Ker</hi> the Clerk of the Commiſſion; his Servant who was ſent over the Water to ſome
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:166443:117"/>
of his friends unto <hi>Edinburgh</hi> from <hi>Perth</hi> immediately after that Meeting of the Commiſſion, to which the Letter of the Presbytery of <hi>Sterling</hi> was ſent. That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did print theſe Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies is no great wonder: it is very like that they would print any thing that did hold forth our defection, and owning of the Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Intereſt. The Third Particular is in the Authors Judgment, a poor mans Argument: But poor men, through mercy, oft-times obtains more ſollid diſcoveries of Divine Truths in a day of tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then the Learned and the Rich do: Neither is it yet a begging of the principal Queſtion, becauſe what was offerred in this, was offered to be inſtructed out of the Regiſters; and they who made the offer were Members of the Aſſembly, who in conſcience and duty, and by the Acts of the Aſſembly which relate to the Conſtitution thereof (as we have already ſhown) were bound to declare their conſcience, touching others who were called to be Conſtituent Members thereof in their Doctrine, Life and execution of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and for the point of that Intereſt it is the ſame thing that was objected by the Remonſtrants againſt the Anti-remonſtrants at the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi>; and by the Prelats in their Declinator 1638. To which we return no other Anſwer, but that of the Brittane Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines at <hi>Dort, Veritas communis Eccleſiae Theſaurus eſt, nec po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ullo pacto fieri peculium, ſingularum perſonarum, Dei &amp; Eccleſiae Publica cauſa eſt non ſua cujuſ<expan>

Why ſhould they be eſteemed, or called Accuſers more then others, propounding Exceptions againſt Conſtituent Members of the Aſſembly? neither was it ever deſired that the propounding of the Exception ſhould be taken for a verification of it; or to ſpeak in the Authors language, That the accuſing of them ſhould be the holding of them for guilty; but only that the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſhould be removed from ſitting as Members in the Aſſembly, till the Exception were tried; and therfore that of <hi>Julian</hi> can have no place in this caſe.</p>

                        <p>THe Author in Anſwering the Inſtance concerning <hi>Blacketer,</hi> ſeems to himſelf to have gotten a great advantage of the Writer his raſhneſs; but though his advantage were as great as he takes it to be, in that particular, it would not better his Cauſe, becauſe multitudes of Inſtances can be given from time to time in

the Gen. Aſſembly of this Church, of removing perſons upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of ſcandal before any conviction of the Fact, or cenſure for the ſame; yea, in the ſame Aſſembly 1651 ſeveral perſons were laid aſide upon exceptions before any legal conviction or ſentence paſt upon the Fact, as the Commiſſioners of ſome Presbyteries, who were proteſted againſt becauſe of oppoſing publick Reſolutions: And the Commiſſioners of the presbytery of <hi>Dunſe,</hi> whoſe Caſe was not cleer in Law, neither yet legally found true as to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact. But let us ſee what it is that he hath gained in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance concerning <hi>Blaketer.</hi> It is agreed on al hands, That <hi>Blaketer</hi> upon proponing of one Exception againſt him, was removed: the matter then is, To give a Reaſon why he was excluded, and the Commiſſioners admitted notwithſtanding of exceptions proponed alſo againſt them. The Writer ſaith, No man in the world can give a Reaſon of it, ſeeing the exceptions on the one hand were as relevant (if not more relevant) then the other. This the Author oppoſes, That they were not ſo relevant: and he brings 5. Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences for proving of it, which may be all reduced to theſe Two, 1 That the ſcandal of the one Caſe was cleer in Law, but ſo was not the other. 2 That for matter of Fact, there was Conviction and Cenſure put upon it; but to paſs that the Aſſembly did not give any the leaſt intimation or hint that in excluding the one, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the other, they found theſe Differences of which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſpeaks. I Anſwer, The ſcandal of the Commiſſioners Caſe was alſo cleer in Law, unleſs we will deny that the ſame Laws which condemned conjunction with, and imploying of Malignants for the time paſt, do alſo condemn them for the time to come, <hi>Tempora mutantur, et nos mutamur in illis:</hi> But Duties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God, and Covenanted by us; and Sins prohibited by God, and engaged againſt by us, are the ſame in the yeer 1648, and in the yeer 1651. As to the matter of Fact, if <hi>Blaketer</hi> was before that time particularly convicted and cenſured, this is indeed <hi>eatenus,</hi> a difference betwixt the one Caſe and the other: but the Author hath alleadged that, without bringing any evidence of the truth of it, and I beleive it ſhall be hard for him to do it. Some who are Members of that Presbytery, whom I have enquired co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this buſineſſe, do profeſs, That they do not remember of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny formal cenſure paſt upon him for his ſubſcribing the band 1648, neither did the Aſſembly at St. <hi>Andrews</hi> at the time of the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:166443:118"/>
of that Exception, give any intimation that they did remove him, becauſe he had been already convicted and cenſured for that Fact: But the Exception being relevant in Law, and the Fact as to his particular concernment therein being alleadged by one of the Meeting, the Aſſembly did lay him aſide until it ſhould be tryed, without further enquiring of the buſineſs at that time.</p>

                     <p>WE ſaid we would not follow the ſeveral Objections where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Writer meets, nor need we; only there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Anſwer to the Fourth Objection, whereto we ſhall ſpeak a word: It being Objected by the Writer himſelf, or ſome other (it matters not by whom) That the Exception could not be taken into conſideration until the Judicatory was firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, and a Moderator choſen, and that therefore it was not againſt the freedom of the Aſſembly, that they did refuſe to fall upon it before that was done: He Replies ſo, as he would ſeem to faſten ſundry points of iniquity upon the Aſſemblies carriage in this matter; if ſaith he, the Aſſembly had immediatly upon the chuſing of the Moderator fallen upon the tryal of that exception, and removed theſe excepted againſt, it would not have looſed, though it might have leſſened the ſtrength of the Argument, but even after that they were allowed to ſit as Members, and to be Judges in every thing elſe, many dayes together, before the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Exception: nay, which is more, before their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings were approven, they ſate as Judges to give vote and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon the very Exception proponed againſt themſelves, the ſame being one of the principal reaſons of the Proteſtation which were condemned before theſe prcoeedings were approven: yet that would not, ſaith he, looſed the difficulty, becauſe the thing deſired was not the trial and diſcuſſing of the exception inſtantly before the chooſing of the Moderator, but that (as it was done to other Members excepted againſt) ſo theſe ſhould be laid aſide until the Aſſembly were conſtituted and take the ſame into Conſideration: This the Aſſembly peremptorily refuſed, and permitted them to vote which was in effect to reject the exception, either as not rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, or as falſe both which were abſurd, the former would have been to contradict clear light of Reaſon: the latter had been to

                        <p>THE Author ſtudies in this place to take off ſome things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged by the Writer in order to the proceedings of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, but let us ſee how he doth it: 1. It is yeelded that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Exception proponed againſt the Commiſſioners, they were not only admitted to ſit and Vote in the choice of a Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, but alſo afterwards in every thing that came before the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly for many dayes together before the trying of their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings; yea, that before that tryal they ſate as Judges to give vote and ſentence upon the Proteſtation, one Reaſon whereof was the Aſsemblies refuſing to remove them, till the Exception proponed againſt them ſhould be diſcuſsed; for the defence whereof he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadges, 1 That the Aſsembly immediatly after the choice of the Moderator, did fall upon the tryal of that Exception: but as that was not enough, becauſe by the Acts of the Aſſembly already ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and conſtant practiſe of Aſſemblies in the matter of Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; Perſons excepted againſt, are immediatly to be laid aſide till the matter be tryed: So was it alſo defective in this, That during the time of the tryal, the Commiſſioners did ſit and Vote in the Aſſembly. 2 He ſaies, That the Aſſembly could not adjourn and be idle all the time that the Committee was to be on that buſineſs: but could not the Aſſembly have ſitten, and be imployed about bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, unleſs theſe who were Members of the Commiſſion did ſit and vote in ſuch buſineſs as came before them? were they Members <hi>ſine quibus non?</hi> 3. He alleadges, That it had been the practiſe of the preceding Aſſemblies ſince 38. But neither doth that looſe the difficulty, becauſe in none of theſe Aſſemblies was there any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception proponed againſt the Commiſſioners, nor was there cauſe
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:166443:120"/>
for it: He is miſtaken in his Inſtance in the Aſſembly 48, as we have already cleered, and therefore he muſt ſeek for another De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. But in that which follows, he plaies the acurate Logician, and finds the Writer in a groſs Paralogiſm, which he thinks can beguile none but theſe, who are too ſimple, and too willing to be beguiled. I would not willingly be beguiled, yet I muſt profeſs my ſelf ſo ſimple, that when I have put on the Authors Spectacles, and looked throw them as attentively as I can, I cannot diſcover the Paralogiſm nor the Sophiſtry thereof, but to me it ſtill ſeems to be a plain and convincing Argument. The Writer alleadges, That the Members of the Commiſſion ſate as Judges to give Vote and Sentence upon the Exception proponed againſt themſelves before the Aſſembly did judge of their proceedings; and he brings this for proof of his alleadgance, That before any Judgment given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent their proceedings, they ſate as Judges upon the Proteſtation, whereof the rejecting of that Exception was a ſpecial Reaſon. To this the Author Anſwers, That it is a Paralogiſm becauſe the thing which was judged, was not the truth or falſhood of the thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it; to wit, Whether the Commiſſioners proceedings were right, or wrong; but only whether the Aſſembly refuſing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Commiſsioners when this Exception was alleadged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, in the way that it was alleadged, and before the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadgance was tryed, did any thing contrary to the freedom and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Aſſembly, or if the Proteſters did wrong the Aſſembly in declining it upon that ground, I ſhall not now trouble my ſelf to prove that by judging of that Reaſon of the Proteſtation they did judge of the proceedings of the Commiſsioners right or wrong, becauſe this will fall in afterwards, more directly in the laſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but taking what the Author grants, I Reaſon thus, Who ſo judges of the relevancy, or non-relevancy of one Exception in order to their own ſitting, or not ſitting Judges of one Exception againſt themſelves: But the Commiſsioners before the approving of their proceedings did judge of the relevancy, or &amp;c. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Firſt Propoſition is cleer, and may be illuſtrated by Inſtances. I ſuppoſe the Author in one aſſembly ſhould object againſt ſome men that they cannot ſit as Members till they be tryed, becauſe they are Papiſts, or Murderers, or Adulterers, which he offereth to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct, and when the Aſſembly comes to judge upon the point &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception relevant or not relevant to remove theſe men, if theſe men
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:166443:120"/>
themſelves ſhould ſit and Vote in this queſtion, were not this to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to be Judges of one Exception proponed againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The Second Propoſition is the Authors own grant, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides other things to that purpoſe, he ſaith, The Commiſsioners ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and Voting as Judges in this matter was no irregularity, or elſe the Aſſembly 48 was alſo irregular, wherein the Proteſters may well remember the Commiſsioners voted as well as other Members upon the relevancy of the Exception given in by the Parliament a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelves: Well then, the Commiſsioners in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, 51. did Vote upon the relevancy of the Exception given in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelves. If any would deny it, it is eaſie to prove it thus, Who ſo were admitted to judge of the relevancy or non-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levancy of the grounds of the Proteſtation were admitted to judge of the relevancy or non-relevancy of that Exception, becauſe it was one of the main grounds of the Proteſtation: But the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Commiſſion, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Author, or ſome others, wil haply think, What need all this? it is granted that it was ſo, and the thing that is denied is, That they did not ſit as Judges to give ſentence of the right or wrong of their own proceedings: Perhaps ere all be done, we ſhall alſo find them doing that, but if it be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, That they did judge of the relevancy of that Exception, all is granted that was alleadged by the Writer, to wit, That they ſate as Judges to give Vote and Sentence upon the very Exception pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned againſt themſelves; and ſo he hath committed no Paralogiſm, but by the Authors own conceſſion which he cannot get avoided: It is proved that the writer did alleadge which was not that they did judge of the right or wrong contained in the exception (though that alſo might have been alleadged) but that they did judge of the Exception proponed againſt themſelves, before any judgment given by the Aſſembly upon their proceedings; and now its granted that they did judge of the relevancy thereof, as to their ſitting or not ſitting; and was not this to be both Judge and Party? who then is guilty of the Paralogiſm the Writer or the Author? The Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſaith, They were admitted to judge of the Exception proponed againſt themſelves; and this by the Authors grant hath a real truth in it, becauſe they were admitted to judge the relevancy or irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levancy of it as to their ſitting or not ſitting (yea the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners did oftner then once judge this before their proceedings were judged by the Aſſembly. Firſt, They judged it at the firſt proponing
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:166443:121"/>
and rejecting thereof by the Aſſembly before the choice of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator, for none of them were then removed, neither was leſs weight laid upon what was ſpoken by them, as to the rejecting of that Exception then upon what was ſpoken by any other Member of the Aſſembly who was not queſtioned. 2 They judged it in judging of the Proteſtaion, at which time they did approve of what the Aſſembly had formerly done in rejecting of it, and did condemn the Propoſers of it, as doing wrong to urge it, and to decline the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly thereupon. The Author ſaith, They were not admitted to ſit as Judges in that Exception, becauſe they did not judg of the right or wrong of the things contained therein; and this is a <hi>non-ſequitur,</hi> becauſe they were admitted to judge of the relevancy thereof which did as well concern them, the exception being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned againſt themſelves, as the right or wrong of the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein. But he alledgeth, 1 That this was no irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or elſe the Aſſembly 48. was as irregular. He doth often make his retreat upon that Aſſembly when he is ſtraited, but it wil allow him no help in this particular, becauſe there was no ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception proponed nor judged in that Aſſembly. 2 He alleadges, That their Voting in that matter of the Proteſtation, being no other thing then that which he hath ſaid, was no prejudice or advantage in the matter of their proceedings, becauſe the alleadgance of their carrying on in their proceedings a courſe of defection at the time, and in the manner that it was alleadged might have been found one un-relevant exception for their removal from being Members before the tryal of their proceedings, and conſequently the refuſing to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it as one exception to that effect an un-relevant ground of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception againſt the Aſſembly, and yet haply afterwards their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings might have been judged to be ſuch as they were alleadged to be without any Croſſing or Contradiction betwixt the one Act and the other. I ſuppoſe that all were true which is here ſpoken of, yet what is this to prove that they did not at all judge of the exceptions proponed againſt themſelves: It is already yeelded, That they did judge of it as to the irrelevancy of it for removing of them before trial. But that the determining of the one, did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the determination of the other: Yea, go far to determine it, I prove Firſt thus, If ſo be the exception as to the relevancy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of did include many Points <hi>de Jure,</hi> the cleering and diſcuſſing whereof did belong moſt intimately and eſſentially to the verifying
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:166443:121"/>
or falſifying of the exception upon the matter itſelf; then did the determining of the one, bring a prejudice to the determination of the other, if not go far to determine: But the Firſt is true, and agreeable to the Authors own words in the next Page of his Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication. <hi>Ergo,</hi> alſo the laſt, The Conexion ſeems cleer becauſe the determining of the relevancy or irrelevancy of the exception did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo determine theſe point<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In theſe things I deal fairly and candid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo far as my light reaches, without detaining the truth in unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, or ſeeking to darken or pervert the ſame ſo far as my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding doth reach; and I think I may refer it to the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of theſe who Condemn the Proteſtation, and that exception as irrelevant if they would have ſo done but upon perſwaſion that the Commiſſioners proceedings were right, and if after the Vote of Condemning the Proteſtation, they could notwithſtanding ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of have alſo condemned their Proceedings.</p>

                     <p>THirdly, Howſoever it be true, that the thing which was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Proteſters in the entry of the Aſſembly, before the choice of the Moderator was not expreſly and formally the trial and diſcuſſion of the Exception given againſt the Commiſſioners, as to the truth alleadged therin, <hi>1.</hi> Whether the Commiſſioners indeed had carried on a courſe of defection from the Covenant and Cauſe, but that the Commiſſioners ſhould have been laid aſide until the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly had been conſtituted to take that into conſideration; yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is that they having been choſen to have been Commiſsioners unqueſtionably by the Society they came from (and that ſome of them by the expreſs vote &amp; conſent of ſome of the Proteſters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as Mr. <hi>Robert Blaire</hi> in the Presbytery, and Mr. <hi>James Wood</hi> in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Samuel Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>) and having a formal Commiſsion, and ſo the Exception be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſonal (as in relation to that Aſſembly) and not propounded againſt their being Commiſsioners: But now in the Aſſembly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veened of neceſsity, the Exception behoved to have been tryed and diſcuſſed and judged, as to the relevancy of it, for their preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving, and laid aſide until it ſhould be tried and diſcuſſed as to the truth of the thing contained in it; for the Writer himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſses, that every Exception upon alleadgance of Scandal is not a ſufficient and relevant ground to that effect: Now there was a great Queſtion about that Exception, namely, concerning a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion <hi>de jure</hi> belonging to it, as we have before cleared. Now tell me, if the Aſſembly before the Election of the Moderator, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was conſtitute into a Judicatory, could try, diſcuſs, and judge that Queſtion (which of neceſsity it behoved to do, ere it could be clear about the relevancy of their exception for their removing, becauſe, as the Writer grants, the exception relevant to remove per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, muſt be <hi>prima fronte,</hi> clear in the Law) Certainly it could not, and therfore of neceſsity they could not upon that exception be removed before the election of the Moderator, and conſtitution of the Judicatory; As for their Members excepted againſt, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon removed, there was a wide difference, the exceptions againſt them were, as to the relevancy for their removing, in caſes every way clear and determined before, in ſo far as was requiſit for that,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:166443:122"/>
to wit, Proteſtations in Presbyteries againſt their election, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding cenſures excluding them from all Kirk Judicatories unrepea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. So we ſee the exception wherewith the Writer meets here, may ſtand good with a little exception, <hi>viz.</hi> That no Exception queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable could be diſcuſſed until the Judicatory were firſt conſtitute, and the Moderator choſen; and therfore it makes nothing againſt the freedom of the late Aſſembly, that before it was conſtitute, and the Moderator choſen, the Commiſsioners were not removed upon the Exception made againſt them, becauſe the relevancy of the Exception was queſtionable in many points <hi>de jure</hi> belonging ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, being controverted, at leaſt not <hi>prima fronte</hi>: The clearing and diſcuſsing thereof did belong most intimatly and eſsentially to the verifying or falſifying of the Exception upon the matter it ſelf, wherwith a meeting not conſtitute into a Judicatory could not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. <hi>4.</hi> As to the Writers Dilemma in the end, That the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to remove the Commiſsioners upon the Exception made againſt them, was to determine, either that the Exception was not relevant or that it was falſe, and both were abſurd. We Anſwer, it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to be determined that it was not relevant in that circumſtance of time when it was proponed for removing them off the Aſsem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; and whereas he ſaith this were to contradict clear reaſon, this is but a naked aſsertion, and we have cleared the contrary.</p>

                        <p>FIrſt, I deſire it to be conſidered, That he yeelds that the thing which was deſired by the Proteſters at the entry of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, before the choice of the Moderator, was not expreſly and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally (yea, nor implicitly nor materially) the trial and diſcuſſing of the Exception, as to the truth alleadged therein; but that the Commiſſioners ſhould have been laid aſide until the Aſſembly had been conſtitute to take the ſame into conſideration, which clears 2. things formerly aſſerted, 1. That it was not deſired that any ſentence ſhould be paſt upon the Commiſſioners by the Aſſembly, before the conſtitution thereof. 2. That the Commiſſioners (before the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their proceedings by the Aſſembly) did judge and give ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon the relevancy of a deſire made againſt themſelvs, to wit, That they might be removed till their proceedings ſhould be firſt judged. 3. I deny not but this Exception behoved to have been tried and diſcuſſed, as to the relevancy of it, ſo far as was needful
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:166443:123"/>
for laying aſide of the Commiſſioners till further trial: and to that which the Author ſaith, That it could not be done becauſe it did involve a great Queſtion <hi>de jure,</hi> which was yet queſtionable, and not clear; whereas it is yeelded by the Writer, that the Exception ought to be relevant in Law, at leaſt ſuch as <hi>prima fronte</hi> ſeems re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levant. I anſwer. That that Queſtion was (<hi>prima fronte</hi>) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levant in Law, becauſe <hi>prima fronte</hi> agreeable to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry letter of the Law. I may appeal to himſelf, if the Publick Reſolutions do not <hi>prima fronte</hi> ſeem to be contrary to many things formerly expreſt in the Acts, Conſtitutions and Publick Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of this Church; and though he would deny it, yet ſure I am all indifferent men will acknowledg it, that whatſoever may be in the matter it ſelf, yet there is at leaſt a ſeeming contrariety betwixt theſe: I ſhall remember him of the ſpeech of a judicious and godly man (whoſe words are cited by himſelf in his Vindication in another caſe) who in a Conference at <hi>St. Andrews</hi> about the Publick Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, when the Acts, Warnings and Declarations of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly was objected againſt theſe Reſolutions, ſaid, <hi>I confeſs that you have the Sough of the Aſſemblies for you</hi>: yea, in this thing that <hi>prima fronte</hi> it ſeems to be ſo, we have the univerſal conſent almoſt of the whole Land, as wel theſe who are for the Publick Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as thoſe who are againſt them; elſe what meant that which was ſo frequent in the mouths of ſome of the Commiſſion, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others the laſt year, who when Acts of Aſſemblies and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Papers were objected, ſaid, That ſome men who had hand in the penning of theſe Papers had upon deſign foiſted in many things in them, which they now made uſe of againſt the Publick Reſolutions; and that which was then, and is ſtill frequenaly ſpoken by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of malignant and diſaffected men in the Land, to wit, The Church is now come to us, and we are not gone to them. Theſe things are more palpable and better known then that they can with any colour of truth be denied. But 3. Was not the Exception pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the Proteſters againſt the Commiſſioners diſcuſſed by the Aſſembly, as to the relevancy thereof, before the election of the Moderator? Did they not, after the propounding of it, ſuffer the Commiſſioners to ſit? which they could not have done unleſs they had rejected it: And how could they reject it, unleſs they had found it irrelevant? Was not the allowing of the Commiſſioners to ſit, after propounding of, and debate upon that Exception, as real a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:166443:123"/>
of the irrelevancy thereof, as the removing of other Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners upon Exceptions propounded againſt them, was a judging of thoſe Exceptions to be relevant? yea, doth not he himſelf expreſly ſay in anſwer to the Writers Dilemma, That it was indeed to be determined, that it was not relevant in that circumſtance of time? 4. I ſee not to what purpoſe it is, that he tels us, That the election of Commiſsioners was not queſtioned in their Presbyteries, that ſome of the Proteſters voted and conſented to the chuſing of them: That they had a formal Commiſsion, and that the Exception was perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal as to that Aſſembly, &amp; not propounded againſt their being Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsioners, but now in the Aſſembly conveened: What is all this as to the keeping of the Aſſembly from conſidering and diſcuſſing of the ſame? VVere there not others who had a formal and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted Commiſsion, not objected againſt in the Presbytery, who yet upon perſonal exceptions propounded in the Aſſembly, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved til theſe exceptions ſhould be diſcuſſed and tried? And was it not as free to propound perſonal exceptions in the Aſſembly as in the Presbytery? and being propounded there, were they not of as great weight as if propounded elſ-where? And ought not the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly to have taken them in conſideration? VVere they not <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo inſtanti,</hi> the proper Judges of them, as well as the Presbytery? That ſome of the Commiſsioners were choſen by expreſs vote and conſent of ſome of the Proteſters themſelves, as Mr. <hi>Robert Blaire</hi> in the Presbytery of <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> Mr. <hi>James Wood</hi> in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of <hi>St. Andrews</hi> by Mr. <hi>Sam. Rutherford</hi>; it may be true, Mr. <hi>Sam. Rutherford</hi> his deſire of Peace and teſtifying of reſpect to theſe men being ſuch as it is, together with the hopes that he had of their being inſtrumental to accommodate things in a right way at the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly: but that hinders not why the Proteſters might not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably propound the Exception at the Aſſembly. Another branch is, That the Aſſembly had not as yet choſen their Moderator, and was not yet conſtitute, and therefore could not diſcuſs that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, &amp;c. But not to repeat that they did diſcuſs the relevancy of other Exceptions, yea, of that ſame that was propounded againſt the Commiſsioners, as to their ſitting, or not ſitting till the matter ſhould be further tried: It is to be conſidered, that if controverted Commiſsions and Members, upon Exceptions propounded againſt them, be laid aſide till trial, which hath alwaies been the cuſtom of the Aſſemblies of this Church. It is not ſo very material whether
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:166443:124"/>
the ful diſcuſsing of the Exception be before the chuſing of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator or after it; there are practiſes and inſtances of both wayes; ſome Aſſemblies firſt diſcuſſing the controverted Commiſsions and Members, and then chuſing the Moderator; others laying aſide theſe things til the Moderator be firſt choſen; and then immediatly before the doing of any thing elſe, falling upon the diſcuſsing of them; though it ſeems the moſt regular way, that the controverted Commiſsions and Members be laid aſide, the uncontroverted ones being a competent number, ſhould proceed to the choice of a Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, and thereafter, before the doing of any thing elſe, put that to a point which concerns the reſt of their conſtituent Members. In the caſe now in queſtion both were deſired, either to diſcuſs the Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to the truth or falſhood of the alleadgance before the chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of a Moderator; or elſe, to lay aſide the Commiſsioners, and to do it immediatly thereafter: but both were refuſed, which was the more conſiderable, becauſe the Exception propounded againſt them, was but meerly perſonal, or upon perſonal or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſcandals, but of more common concernment, and in things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Cauſe, as breach of Publick Truſt, defection from the Cauſe and Covenant, which did require conſideration before the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting theſe perſons. I would ask the Author this one Queſtion: Upon ſuppoſal that the Aſſembly after the Commiſsioners ſitting and voting therein many dayes; yea, even in the condemning of the Proteſtation, and citing of the Proteſters; ſhould have found their proceedings to involve a courſe of defection from the Cauſe and Covenant, and therupon have removed and cenſured them: Could Beholders have looked upon this as a handſom way of proceeding, that they would not take into conſideration an Exception deſerving ſuch things, when it was firſt propounded unto them, and offered to be inſtructed; but would judge the Exception irrelevant, cenſure others for proteſting, becauſe of refuſing to accept of it: admit the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſsioners to be fellow-Judges in condemning that Proteſtation &amp; after al this find theſe Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſsioners guilty of the thing alleadged in that ſame very Exception when ffrſt proponed, &amp; remove &amp; cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them upon it; Are things handſom? or do they wel cohere? or can a tender eye look upon them without offence? How much fairer had it been, firſt to remove them, and preſently or immediately after the choice of the Moderator, to diſcuſs the Exception? There is more danger to the Cauſe, &amp; offence to God &amp; his People in raſh
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:166443:124"/>
admiting ſuch as are guilty, then in cautious delaying even of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent perſons when legally challenged: If innocent, they may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be admitted with more honour and reſpect; but if guilty, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhal be continued Members with much detriment to the cauſe, or elſe ſhalbe caſten out with more ſhame both to themſelvs and to the Aſſembly, who at firſt refuſed to lay them aſide till they were tryed. Becauſe the Author ſaw that an objection might be moved againſt what he hath ſaid from the Aſſemblies removing of other Members who were excepted againſt before the choice of the Moderator; therefore for preventing of it he tells us, that there was a wide difference, becauſe the exceptions againſt them, were as to their relevancie for their removing, in caſes every way clear and determined before, in ſo far as was requiſite for that, to wit, Proteſtations in Presbyteries againſt their election, ſtanding cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, excluding them from all Church-Judicatories unrepealed: To which I return theſe particulars; Firſt, Some even before the choice of the Moderator were removed upon exceptions againſt whoſe elections there was no Proteſtation, and who were under no ſtanding cenſure either of one kinde or another, to wit, Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Canden</hi> Commiſsioner from the Presbytery of <hi>Dunce,</hi> who was removed upon this exception, that that Presbytery could not chooſe Commiſsioners, being ſo few in number as they were; here was no Proteſtation, the man under no cenſure, yea nor the ground of the exception clear and unqueſtionable in Law as to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny act of any former Aſſembly, onely <hi>primâ fronte,</hi> it ſeemed rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant that two or three could not chooſe; therefore was be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon removed, though afterwards, (if my information hold) he was again (as ſeems upon not finding the exception not relevant) admitted. Secondly, Neither was a Proteſtation againſt the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſufficient to make it clear upon the Authors grounds. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that it had been alleadged, that the ground of the Proteſtation was not clear, but queſtionable; as to the relevancy of it by his ground ſuch a Proteſtation againſt the election, would not have been enough to lay the Commiſsioners aſide, till the matter had been tryed. To come nearer the caſe, let us ſuppoſe that ſome of the oppoſers of Publick Reſolutions had in the Presbyterie or in the Univerſite of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> proteſted againſt the election of the Commiſsioners there, upon this ground, that theſe who were ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, were inſtrumentall in the Publick Reſolutions, will the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:166443:125"/>
ſay, this had been ſufficient to lay theſe Commiſsioners aſide, from ſitting as Members of the Aſſembly, till the matter had been tryed: If ſo, why then was not the proponing of that exception in the Aſſembly againſt all theſe who were Members of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion, and had hand in theſe Reſolutions, ſufficient to lay them aſide: Os, if that be denyed, I would deſire to know a reaſon of the difference, if it be ſaid, that all the Commiſsions which were laid aſide, becauſe of Proteſtations againſt them, were ſuch as were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted againſt upon clear &amp; unqueſtionable grounds. I anſwer, that it was not ſo, as appears by the inſtance already given, to which I adde another, to let ſee what partiality of proceeding there was in theſe things even upon the Authors own grounds: Did not the Aſſembly lay aſide the Commiſſion of theſe who were firſt choſen by the Presbytery of <hi>Glaſgow</hi> upon this ground, that the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners were oppoſers of the Publick Reſolutions, which (if we may believe the Author) was yet a queſtionable hypotheſis <hi>in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.</hi> Thirdly, I ſuppoſe that in theſe caſes which (he ſaith) were clear, any perſons intereſted ſhould have objected, that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation was falſe and fictitious; or that their being uoder cenſure, was a meer alleadgance, or that the ground of the Proteſtation and cenſure was an hypotheſis not yet determined <hi>in jure.</hi> I ask him, whether the Aſſembly in theſe caſes, was to admit the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or to lay aſide the Commiſſions, and remove the perſons, till the matter ſhould be tryed? If he ſay, they were not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, then they behoved to refuſe to hear all Parties intereſſed, and to take a queſtionable caſe for clear and granted, before they hear and try which ſeems to be abſurd. If he ſay, that they were to fall upon the diſcuſſing of queſtions and objections <hi>hinc inde,</hi> then I pray you, why not one queſtionable exception as well as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other? Why not the queſtionable exception proponed againſt the Commiſſioners, as well as the queſtionable exception contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Proteſtation againſt the election in Presbyteries? And if he ſay, that it was not abſurd to lay aſide the perſons, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of their alleadging that the Proteſtation was falſe and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitious, &amp;c. but that the matter being queſtionable, they were to be laid aſide till it ſhould be tryed and cleared; then why not alſo the Commiſsioners upon the exception of a ſcandall of defection proponed againſt them notwithſtanding of their denying thereof, and aſſerting the contrary, ſeeing (by his own ground) the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:166443:125"/>
was not yet clear to the Aſſembly, either upon the one hand or the other. By theſe things we may ſee what will come of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors concluſion, to wit, that no exception queſtionable could be diſcuſſed, until the Judicatory were firſt conſtituted, and the Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator choſen; and that therefore it makes nothing againſt the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the late Aſſembly, that before it was conſtituted, and the Moderator choſen, that the Commiſsioners were not removed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the exception made againſt them, becauſe the relevancy of the exception was queſtionable in many things <hi>de jure,</hi> belonging thereunto, being controverted at leaſt, and not <hi>primâ fronte</hi> clear; the clearing and diſcuſsing whereof, did belong moſt intimately and eſſentially to the verifying or falſifying of the exception upon the matter it ſelf; whereupon the Meeting not conſtitute into a Judicatory could not meddle; upon which Concluſion I ask theſe queſtions. Firſt, If no exception queſtionable could be diſcuſſed untill the Judicatory were conſtitute, and the Moderator choſen, then, how did the Meeting at <hi>St. Andrews</hi> before the conſtituting of the Judicatory, and chooſing of the Moderator, reject the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception proponed by the Proteſters againſt the Commiſsioners, as not relevant to remove them, was not that to diſcuſſe an exception queſtionable, as to the relevancie of being a ground of removing or not removing. Secondly, I ask how it came to paſſe that they removed the Commiſsioners of <hi>Glaſgow</hi> upon the exception of their oppoſing the Publick Reſolutions, was not that alſo to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſe an exception queſtionable, as to the relevancie of being a ground, as before. Thirdly, If the relevancy of the exceptions was queſtionable in many points <hi>De jure</hi> belonging thereunto, the clearing and diſcuſsing whereof, did belong moſt intimatly and eſſentially to the verifying or falſifying of the matter it ſelf, how could it be judged and diſcuſſed as to the relevancy thereof, and yet this be no prejudice to a judgement upon the matter contained therein? or how could the exception be found non-relevant, and the Commiſsioners proceedings be alſo found to involve a courſe of defection. Fourthly, If the clearing and diſcuſsing of that exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption had ſuch connection with the matter of the Commiſsioners proceedings that firſt when it was proponed, it could not be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the judging of the queſtionable hypotheſis of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, how came it to paſs that the Aſſembly afterward did judge it, and admitted the Commiſsioners themſelves to ſit as jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:166443:126"/>
therein before the judging of that hypotheſis. Fifthly, If the exception was ſo queſtionable <hi>in jure,</hi> how could the Aſſembly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the diſcuſsing of the Commiſsioners proceedings, ſo ſeverely reprove the diſſenters for proponing of it, and condemne the Proteſtation founded thereupon. Theſe things to my weak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding ſeems inconſiſtent, and ſuch as ordinary Readers can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reconcile. In the laſt place he labors to give anſwer to the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>Dilemma,</hi> to wit, at the refuſing to remove the Commiſsion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers upon the exception proponed againſt them, was to determine either that the exception was not relevant, or it was falſe, but both were abſurd. His anſwer is, That it was indeed to be determined, that it was not relevant in that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time when it was proponed for removing of them from the Aſſembly, and this he denyes to have been abſurd or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict clear reaſon, and tells us, that he hath cleared the contrary. When I had read theſe words again and again, I could not with any perſwaſion, fall upon the Authors meaning, his way of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion being dubious, he ſaith, <hi>it was to be determined,</hi> which makes me ſuſpect that he may haply point at the determination which was afterwards made by the Aſsembly, when the relevancy of that exception was condemned in the Proteſtation: If that be his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he hath but covered himſelf with fig-tree leaves, becauſe the rejecting of it was the actuall determining of the irrelevancy of it, as to the being a ground of removing the Commiſsioners out of the Aſsembly; but if he mean that it was determined not relevant when proponed; I would know why it was not relevant in that circumſtance of time, whether becauſe of the matter contained therein, as not being relevant <hi>in jure,</hi> or becauſe the Aſsembly could not judge thereof, the Moderator not being yet choſen, nor the Aſsembly conſtituted? If he ſay, not relevant upon the matter at that circumſtance of time, then this non-relevancie was either becauſe the exception was founded upon things done by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsioners agreeable to the Law, and ſo no matter of exception, but matter or commendation, or elſe becauſe founded upon things queſtionable, and yet not determined <hi>in jure</hi>: Not the firſt, becauſe that had been to determine the Commiſſioners proceedings to be agreeable to the Law before the trying of them: Not the laſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that had been to determine, that the proceedings of the Commiſſioners were not yet determined by the doctrine of the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:166443:126"/>
Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> before the trying and judging of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. The truth is, the Aſſembly gave no ſuch judgment upon that exception, nor no ſuch reaſon of their rejecting of it; but the only reaſon that was ſpoken of, and did carry the buſineſſe in the Aſſembly was, that the Aſſembly could not fall upon the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of it, the Moderator not yet being choſen, and the Aſſembly not conſtituted; &amp; if this be the Authors meaning, when he ſaith it waa indeed to be determined not relevant in that circumſtance of time when it was proponed. It is no anſwer at all; Firſt, Becauſe the Aſsembly could have judged thereof before the chooſing of the Moderator, other Aſſemblies ſeverall times having ſo done; and this ſame Aſsembly did judge the relevancy of ſundry exceptions, as to the laying aſide of the Commiſſioners; yea the irrelevancy of this ſame exception by the Authors own conceſsion in theſe very words; by what authority they could judge the relevancy of one exception, by the ſame authority they might have judged the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levancy of another, and by what authority they could reject it as irrelevant, by the ſame authority they could have diſcuſsed it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levant or not relevant. Secondly, Becauſe it was alſo urged af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the chooſing of the Moderator, but was not then condeſcended unto; but the Commiſsioners againſt whom it was proponed, were ſtill allowed to ſit as Members of the Aſsembly, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any regard to that exception, which gave probable grounds to think, that the rejecting of it before the choice of a Moderator upon that pretext, was but a meer pretext: becauſe a Moderator now being choſen, it was ſtill rejected; and therefore rejected as <hi>ſimpliciter</hi> irrelevant, without reference to any circumſtance of time, as appeareth by condemning it in the Proteſtation. But it may haply be ſaid, That by the circumſtance of time when it was proponed, he means all the intervall of time that was between the proponing of it, and the judging of the Commiſsioners proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. If ſo it was relevant in no circumſtance of time, it being proponed meerly in order to their removall for that intervall of time, when their proceedings were now approven and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it would have been very impertinent and uſeleſſe to propone any ſuch exception. He would let his Readers know in what circumſtance of time it was relevant. As to the removing of the Commiſsioners before judging of their proceedings; for if any circumſtance of that time it was relevant, the Aſſembly did wrong
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:166443:127"/>
in not finding it to be ſo; and if in no circumſtance of that time it was relevant as to that effect, he doth but triffle with his Readers in telling them that it was not relevant in that circumſtance of time it was proponed, it had been candide and fair dealing to have told them that it was relevant in no circumſtance of that time, or not relevant at all, but this would not have been well digeſted.</p>

                     <p>SO we ſhall now paſſe to the next ground of the Proteſtation, what is contained in the Writer of the ſecond Paper his replyes to the firſt objection; or other Objections is either nothing to the infrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of our anſwer, or cleared by what hath been ſaid already, only this much I adde, Theſe men who he ſaith hath fallen from their ſtedfastneſſe, and made defection, at which others could not wink, becauſe of their former integrity; ſome of them have been ſtedfaſt in the truth and Cauſe of God, when others that accuſes them knew it not: ſome of them we doubt not will by Gods grace give teſtimony of their ſtedfaſtneſſe in it in their ſuffering condition, when ſome that accuſes them may be will be found, or already are tampering about and deviſing gloſſes how they may with ſome colour ſhuffell them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves looſe from Articles of the Covenant; And the Writer ſhal never be able to inſtance that they have made defection in their late Reſolutions, either from any Article of the Covenant, or from the truth of Religion in any head thereof, Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline and Government received and eſtabliſhed in this Kirk, or from practiſing according to that truth, I mean by any Publick allowed practiſe or courſe contrary thereunto, for as for perſon all failings add ſhort commings in particular duties, they know themſelves to be but men compaſſed with a body of death, and we doubt not but they are as far from Phariſaicall juſtifying of themſelves as others. As to the other partculars mentioned in the Proteſtation 'that they ſtirred up the Civill Magiſtrate againſt ſuch as were unſatisfied with their Proceedings; Its contrary to truth as ſhall be cleared afterwards, there alleadged prelimitating of the Aſſembly, is cleared before, as it formed and inlarged in the ſecond Paper. The Meeting at <hi>St. Andrews</hi> had no liberty nor freedome to vote in matters agitated and debated therein, which is alleadged to be manifeſt from the particulars, that the Commiſſion had in their Remonſtrances and Papers ſtirred up the Civill Magiſtrate againſt ſuch as did differ from them in their Reſolutions and Proceedings,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:166443:127"/>
and accordingly the Magiſtrate had confined ſome Miniſters; <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe of <hi>Sterline</hi> upon that accompt, and had made Laws and Acts of Parliament ordaining all ſuch to be proceeded againſt as ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Religion and the Kingdom. <hi>2.</hi> The Commiſſioners had by their Warnings and Papers to Presbyteries, ſtirred up the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries to cenſure ſuch, and cite them to the Generall Aſſembly, and accordingly the Presbyteries did cite many of them. <hi>3.</hi> The Kings Majeſty wrote to the Aſſembly a Letter moving and ſtirring them up to puniſh and cenſure thoſe who differed from the Publick Reſolutions, and the Commiſſioner did ſecond the ſame by his ſpeech to the Aſſembly, intimating, that he hoped ſuch a courſe ſhould be taken with them, that all others may be deterred from the like thereafter, none of theſe things that Meeeing did reſent, but were ſilent thereat, and afterwards did approve. I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> To the firſt particular, it is contrary to the truth that the Commiſſion had in their Papers ſtirred up the Civill Magiſtrate againſt ſuch as did differ from them about their Reſolutions and Proceedings; the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter if he would have dealt ingenuouſly and faithfully, either with the Commiſsioners, or with ſuch as was to read this Paper, he ſhould have inſtanced or produced ſome, at leaſt one or two (for he ſpeaks as if this had been done in ſundry Papers) paſſages out of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers bearing this. <hi>2.</hi> That the Civill Magiſtrate did confine (as the Writer termeth, their requiring them to ſtay at <hi>Perth</hi> for a ſpace, untill their buſineſſe ſhould be cognoſced) the Miniſters of <hi>Sterlin</hi> being ſtirred up thereunto by the Commiſſioners, and that he confined them upon that accompt, <hi>viz.</hi> That they differed from the Publick Reſolutions, both are affirmed wrongfully and contrary to the truth, the real ſtory of that buſineſſe was this in ſumme: The Committee being informed that the Miniſters of <hi>Sterlin</hi> were in their publick Doctrine, and otherwiſe practiſing the hindering of the Leavies, according to Publick Reſolutions, and moving ſundry perſons in the Garriſon of <hi>Sterlin</hi> to quite and deſert their charge, which tended to the endangering of the whole Land, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that Garriſon, the only Bulwark of the whole land under God, the Committee repreſented the matter to the Commiſsion of the Generall Aſsembly, ſhewing them that they could not permit that Garriſon to be endangered, yet in regard they were Miniſters, they deſired the Commiſsion to take a dealing with them firſt, and required the Commiſsion to make report to them what effect their
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:166443:128"/>
dealing with their brethren ſhould take. The Commiſsioners accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly having met at <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> and having had a Conference with theſe Brethren, &amp; having found by their own acknowledgment that in Publick they had practiſed againſt Publick Reſolutions, &amp; in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate had given to ſome perſons as they ſaid, asking their advice, reſolution that it was not lawfull to continue in that ſervice being in ſuch a conjunction as the Reſolutions carried: Firſt they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to give them ſatisfaction about their reſolutions, but having effectuated nothing therein, at laſt they dealt with them in moſt earneſtneſſe and tenderneſs, both publickly and privatly to give aſsurance that they would not proceed to do or ſpeak any thing in their Publick Doctrine, or in private to the hindering and obſtructing of the Leavies which were going on, according to the Reſolutions; or might tend to the moving of any of the Garriſon to quite their charge, which they refuſed peremptorily to do, and ſo departed home from the Conference: The Commiſsion having ſent a meer report and narration; <hi>rei geſtae,</hi> without more or leſs to the Committee of Eſtates, according as they were required; the Committee required theſe Brethren by Letter to come to <hi>Perth,</hi> that ſome courſe might be taken in relation to them for ſecuring the Garriſon of <hi>Sterlin</hi> from danger. The Brethren having come to <hi>Perth,</hi> but not at the firſt Diet appointed to them, the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee required them to attend at <hi>Perth,</hi> or at <hi>Dundee,</hi> untill the Kings return from <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> that there might be a more ful Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Committee, a great part of the moſt conſiderable mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof being with him, after the Kings return, a Paper being ſent in by the Committee of Eſtates to the Commiſsion of the Kirk, requiring the Commiſsions advice as about other Paſſages that had paſſed between them and theſe Brethren, what ſhould be done with theſe Brethren in relation to ſecuring of the Garriſon of <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,</hi> the Commiſsion declared in their anſwer as to this, they could not take upon them to determine, the matter being meerly Civil, but that they deſired and expected that the Committee would deal with them in tenderneſſe and reſpect, as being Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; this is the truth of the buſineſſe in ſum, ſo it doth appear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, that the Civill Magiſtrate did confine them (as they are ſo pleaſed to term it) neither being ſtirred up thereunto by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsioners, nor yet upon their accompt of meer difference from the Commiſsion, and Publick Reſolutions, but upon the accompt of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:166443:128"/>
their active oppoſing of their Reſolutions to the obſtruction of the Leavies, and endangering the Garriſon, and their refuſing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt from that oppoſition; but neither muſt it be forgotten here what was the time of that confinment (as the Writer termeth it) and compearing of theſe Brethren before the Committee: If the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be ignorant of it, let him know it was this, Mr. <hi>Robert Dowglas,</hi> and Mr. <hi>James Wood</hi> being dealt with by ſome of theſe Brethrens intimate friends, to interceed with the Parliament that was then conveened to paſſe from calling them further, did readily undertake it &amp; obtained their deſire, ſo that they were diſmiſsed preſently, and then one of theſe Brethren came and acknowledged to theſe two their kindneſſe done in their behalfe, yet now in the Proteſtation, and in this ſecond Paper it is requited with a ſlander, that they with other Commiſsioners ſtirred up the Civill Magiſtrate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them for differing from Publick Reſolutions.</p>

                        <p>BEfore the Author come to anſwer the next ground of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation; he takes notice of ſomethings, and but of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, (paſſing by many others) ſpoken of by the Writer in his anſwer concerning the Commiſſioners, their ſtedfaſtneſſe and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling off from it. To which I reply, that though it may be true that ſome of them have been ſtedfaſt in the Truth &amp; Cauſe of God, when others whom he calls their accuſers knew it not, that will neither juſtifie the one nor condemn the other; In the things of God it doth ſometimes fall out, that <hi>the firſt are laſt, and the laſt firſt</hi>; though yet if he make an impartiall reckoning, I believe that neither he nor his party have reaſon to prefer themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Proteſters for men of integrity, and old ſtanding in the Cauſe of God, nor yet to boaſt themſelves, as though there were none among them who had but lately come to know the Cauſe of God; I hope no Proteſter doth, or ſhall envy ſome of theſe mens giving teſtimony of their ſtedfaſtneſſe for the time to come in their ſufferings. The Lord fit them &amp; all his people ſo to do: But it is not enough for the Author to ſpeak thus promiſingly of them, unles up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his <hi>may bees</hi> he do alſo prognoſticat evil of others: He tels us, that when ſome of theſe accuſers it may be wil be found tampering, or already are tampering about or deviſing gloſſes how they may
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:166443:129"/>
with ſome colour ſhufle themſelvs looſe from Articles of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſome of them wil give teſtimony of their ſtedfaſtnes in it. This meaſure wherewith the Author repayeth the Proteſters, is more then an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth; they did not except againſt the Commiſſioners upon <hi>may bees,</hi> but upon things really and already done, and to his may be, I ſay: That though this be a hour of temptation, wherein many turn aſide both to the left hand and to the right; yet I hope that by the Lords grace, the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of thoſe who have born teſtimony againſt the Publick Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſhal be found among the moſt ſtedfaſt in the Land in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and Cauſe of God: What if I ſhould tell him that it may be when oppoſers of Publick Reſolutions are keeping their integrity, and cleaving to the Covenant, ſome men of no ſmall note who have been, and ſtill are zealous for theſe Reſolutions, will be lick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the vomite of Malignancy and Prelacy, or if that be to fiſh too far before the net; I am content to appeal to himſelf who are the greateſt tamperers of this time, whether the followers of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Reſolutions or the oppoſers of them. I do not reſolve to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny an honourable teſtimony to not a few of theſe who are for the Publick Reſolutions, in their love unto, and ſtedfaſtnes in, and zeal for the truth in other things, nor yet to juſtifie the turnings aſide of others who have been oppoſers of the Publick Reſolutions; yet I think it will not be queſtioned that the generality of theſe who have given up the Intereſts both of Church &amp; State into the hands of ſtrangers, are ſuch as were affectionatly zealous for the publick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, which is too probable an evidence that their profeſſions of Repentance the laſt year, and of zeal for the Covenant and work of Reformation, and of love to the King, and of deſire to preſerve our Liberties were not ſtraight and upright; and that the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Church who after ſo many experiences of their turning aſide, did truſt them, and were inſtrumentall to imploy them in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Cauſe and Kingdom, hath cauſe to think that they were a little too credulous. I ſhal not inſiſt upon what the Author ſaith of the Writers never being able to prove what he aſſerts anent the Commiſſioners their making defection; This as to the matter of the Publick Reſolutions, hath been ſufficiently proven either by him or others, and needs not here to be repeated; Therefore I come to what he brings in anſwer to theſe things which are brought by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

The Writer for proving this, alleadges, that the Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had ſtirred up the civill Magiſtrate againſt ſuch as did differ from them in the Publick Reſolutions in their Warnings and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances; This the Author denyes as being contrary to truth and calls for proof of it out of theſe Warnings and Remonſtrances; Theſe Warnings and Remonſtrances being Publick and common, I conceive that the Writer thought it not needful to cite the places, nor to inſiſt much upon proof of the buſineſs other ways then in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancing the reall effects of it; but becauſe he deſires evidence from theſe Papers he ſhall have it: 1. The Commiſſion in their ſhort exhortation to the Miniſters and Profeſſors of this Kirk, <hi>March</hi> 20. 1651. expreſſe themſelves thus in order to theſe who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied with, or do oppoſe the Publick Reſolutions; The Conſcience of our duty (according to the truſt committed to us, and the carriage of ſome who either oppreſt with a lethargy ly ſtil or ſeaſed upon by a benumming coldnes move ſlowly, or carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with the winde of ſtrange Doctrine, as children are toſſed to &amp; fro &amp; move contrarily) doth conſtrain us to lift up our voices, &amp; from the watch tower whereon we are ſet to give Warning to the Profeſſors &amp; Miniſters throughout the Land, &amp; to wacken them up to their duty, as they would avoid the diſpleaſure of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and eſcape the deſerved puniſhments and cenſures which may be inflicted by Judicatories Civill and Eccleſiaſtick <hi>reſpective</hi> upon dificients in, and Delinquents againſt duty, according to the degree of their offence, and again in the ſame Warning, having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the charecter of Malignants to ſuch as through diſſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Publick Reſolutions, were ſilent or did oppoſe; they uſe theſe words, we wiſh it may be the care of all to ſhun the ways that may bring them under theſe foul charecters, and wherby they may run themſelves under the hazard of the diſpleaſure of God, and the cenſures of the Church, and no doubt of civil puniſhments alſo to be inflicted by the State; From theſe paſſages theſe two things are manifeſt: 1. That in the judgement of the Commiſsion, defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in the Publick Reſolutions, by not moving at all, or ſlow moving, or contrary moving, was deſervably lyable to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the Civill Magiſtrate. 2. That they did make no doubt but that civill puniſhment would be inflicted by the State: To theſe two things adde, That this exhortation and Warning is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to all the Miniſters and Profeſſors of this Kirk, and ſo to the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:166443:130"/>
civil Magiſtrat among others in their place &amp; ſtation; yea, no doubt before the emitting thereof, it was by way of correſpondencie, according to the conſtant cuſtome kept in theſe things communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated unto the State; let any indifferent man then judge whether this be not a ſtirring up of the Civill Magiſtrate againſt them, when it is declared to the Civill Magiſtrate in a publick exhortation and Warning to duty, that puniſhment from the Civill Magiſtrat is by theſe men deſerved, and that the State will no doubt inflict that civil puniſhment in anſwering the inſtances of the Civil Magiſtrate his Proceeding accordingly: The one of them, to wit, their making of Lawes and Acts of Parliament, appointing ſuch to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded againſt as enemies to Religion, and to the Kingdom, he doth not ſo much as once touch, and the other concerning the confining the Miniſters of <hi>Sterline,</hi> he doth in many things mince and pervert, therefore for informing of the Readers, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying of what is ſaid by the Writer in this particular; I ſhal ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truly ſet down the matter of fact ſo far as is needfull, and make ſome remarks upon what the Author ſaith in this buſin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ſſe; Firſt to the matter of fact, it was thus: After that the Miniſters of <hi>Sterline</hi> did return to their ſtations from the Conference with the Commiſſion at <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> the Committee of Eſtates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed by the Commiſsion of the reſult of that Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and hearing that the Miniſters of <hi>Sterline</hi> did continue to Preach againſt the Publick Reſolutions, did reſolve upon a Letter containing a citation, to come to <hi>Perth</hi> to be written from the Committee to theſe Miniſters, which being paſt and approven in the Committee, was immediatly thereafter by ſome of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber communicated to the Commiſsion of the Kirk, to whom it was publickly read, without ſo much as the leaſt ſignification made by them of their diſlike thereof, which did clearly enough import their approbation of the ſame, becauſe it was the cuſtome of the Commiſsion theſe years paſt, when any thing was communicated unto them by the Parliament or Committee of Eſtates, with which they were not ſatisfied, either to repreſent their diſſatisfaction in a humble way by Writing, or elſe to deſire a Conference thereupon, and when they were ſilent, it was always exponed to import their ſatisfaction; This Letter being diſpatched from <hi>Perth</hi> where the Committee of Eſtates then ſate, to the Miniſters of <hi>Sterline,</hi> it came not to their hands before the Tueſday at night, notwithſtanding
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:166443:130"/>
that it had been writen a good many dayes before, and that it did require them to compear before the Committee the next day after recept thereof: The one of the Miniſters being ſomewhat ſickly, anſwer was returned from both to the Lord <hi>Chancelor</hi> Preſident of the Committee, that by reaſon of his weakneſſe, they could not well keep the Diet mentioned in the Letter, but that in the caſe of his being able to travell, both of them ſhould be at <hi>Perth</hi> that week, or that if he could not travell, the other ſhould come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fail, and intreating the Lord <hi>Chancelor</hi> to make their excuſe to the Committee, and that it might not be interpreted as any ſign of diſ-reſpect, or diſobedience, that they did not come inſtantly upon the recept of the Letter, ſeing the one of them was not at that time able to travell: This Letter being communicated by the Lord <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celor</hi> to the Committee upon the Thurſday, they were pleaſed notwithſtanding thereof, and before the comming or hearing of theſe Miniſters, to order another Letter to be ſent unto them, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining them to come to <hi>Perth</hi> before the next Saturnday at night, and to ſtay there, or at <hi>Dundee</hi> til the Kings return from <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> whether he was then going; before this ſecond Letter came to their hands, theſe Miniſters came to <hi>Perth</hi> upon the Friday at night upon the firſt Letter, and making application to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Eſtates on the Saturday morning, did (after Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they did not acknowledge them as judges in the matter of their doctrine) profeſt themſelves willing and ready to hear and to anſwer what the Committee of Eſtates had to challenge them of, upon which the Committee did intimate unto them the order contained in their ſecond Letter, and cauſed the Clerk deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ſame unto them; the Miniſters of <hi>Sterlin</hi> after hearing the order contained therein, did earneſtly beſeech the Committee of Eſtates that (upon ſurety to compear when they ſhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for) they might have liberty to return to their Charges, which being denyed, they did in the next place deſire, that ſeing they had no purpoſe to go unto <hi>Dundee,</hi> they might be permitted to go 3. or 4. miles without <hi>Perth</hi> for refreſhing of themſelves, which favour was at firſt granted, and within a little ſpace thereafter, they being gone to their lodgings, was recalled, and they were ſent for to come back to the Committee of Eſtates; and when they came it was intimated unto them, that the Committee could not take it upon them to allow them that liberty; therefore were they
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:166443:131"/>
conſtrained either to be tranſgreſſors of the Committees order, or elſe to abide within the Town of <hi>Pearth,</hi> which they did for ſome weeks, untill the King and others of the Committee, having retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from <hi>Aberdeen</hi> upon the Friday afternoon, and a report being made in the Committee of Eſtates what had paſt concerning the Miniſters or <hi>Sterline,</hi> they did that ſame night appoint another or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be ſent unto them, ordaining them to ſtay in the Town till the Commiſſion of the Church ſhould meet, and that it might be thought upon, what courſe was to be taken in theſe things, which was accordingly done, and the Parliament meeting at <hi>Perth</hi> the next week thereafter, they did ſend unto theſe Miniſters two Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, commanding them to ſtay that week; which being expired, they ſent unto them another perſon, commanding them to ſtay their further order. During this time the Commiſsion of the Church met at <hi>Pearth,</hi> to whom all that had paſt betwixt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Eſtates and theſe Miniſters, was communicated firſt by theſe Miniſters themſelves, and afterwards by the Parliament, who deſired to know the Commiſsions judgment of two Proteſtations given in to the Committee of Eſtates by theſe Miniſters, the ſum whereof was, that their compearing before them to anſwer in theſe things that did relate to their Doctrine and diſcharge of their Miniſteriall function, might not import that they did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them to be competent Judges thereof; and that incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was made upon the due liberty of the Subject, by a ſentence of Confinement paſt upon them, without hearing them after they were called to be heard; Which Proteſtations being taken in conſideration by the Commiſsion, they did give their judgment thereof in a large Paper condemning the ſame, without ſo much as calling theſe Miniſters, to ask a reaſon of their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment anent the things contained therein, notwithſtanding that they were in Town, and had communicated the ſame unto them, and all that paſt betwixt the Committee of Eſtates and them, by this narration, which can be verified from the Regiſters and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers themſelves, as to the ſubſtance and moſt of the Circumſtances of it, and (which cannot be juſtly contradicted in any circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance thereof, for if it ſhould, can be atteſted by witneſſes) it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that there was a legall ſentence of Confinement paſt, and often renewed upon theſe Miniſters, before hearing of the Party, and that this Confinement was for a Moneths time, and that with
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:166443:131"/>
was done therein (as to the ſubſtance of it) was done with the knowledge and connivance, if not direct approbation and allowance of the Commiſsion. The Author in his Relation firſt carps at the word of <hi>Confinement.</hi> But I would know of him what was here wanting of a Confinement, properly ſo called, was there not a Judicial Sentence, tying thoſe Miniſters to ſuch a place, for ſuch a time and, reſtraining them in the uſe of their liberty from going to their own homes and ſtations, or to any place elſe, except theſe places mentioned in the Order of the Committee of Eſtates. 2. He alleadges, that it is affirmed wrongfully and contrary to the truth, that the Commiſsioners ſtirred up the Civil Magiſtrate againſt the Miniſters of <hi>Sterline,</hi> or that they were confined upon the accompt of their differing from the publick Reſolutions. The Writer did not ſpeak of any particular inſtigation coming from the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners to the civil Magiſtrate in the particular of theſe Miniſters, but gives one Inſtance therin of the Magiſtrates proceedings according to the general warnings of the Commiſſion wherin they do declare their Judgment of the deſert of ſuch things, and that <hi>the ſtate will no doubt inflict civil puniſhment upon them,</hi> though yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides any thing that is already ſpoken that the Commiſſion was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with theſe things; and did in every bodies conſtruction allow therof: Somewhat more could be told him concerning ſome leading men in the Commiſſion, which I am now content to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs. When I read the other particular, to wit, his affirming it to be contrary to truth, that they were confined upon accompt of differing from the publick Reſolutions: I did ſomewhat wonder what could make him write ſo, were they not Confined, becauſe of their publick Preaching and expreſsing their disſatisfaction in publick and private with theſe Reſolutions. The Author cals it, Their oppoſing and practiſing againſt publick Reſolutions, and their active diſpoſing of their Reſolutions to the obſtructing of the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies, and indangering of the Garriſon, and their refuſing to deſiſt from that Oppoſition, let him give it as many names as he will, and aggravate it by all the Circumſtances that he can, it is ſtill upon the accompt of their differing from the publick Reſolutions, doth he (when he hath ſtrained himſelf to the utmoſt) give inſtance of any other thing, or of any thing that they did in this, that was not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for Miniſters to do in the diſcharge of their miniſterial Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Upon ſuppoſal that theſe Reſolutions were wrong, they write
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:166443:132"/>

As for their indangering of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, which he is pleaſed to call the only Bulwark of the whole Land under God: I wiſh that it may be remembered, and laid to heart, That the Lord was graciouſly pleaſed (as long as theſe Miniſters were there) to preſerve that Garriſon without any appearance of danger or hazard, and that after they were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven away it was firſt abandoned by our Army, when men were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them who preached according to their heart; and afterwards, whithout any oppoſition, given up to the hands of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by theſe who had ſlandered theſe Miniſters, as compliers with them, and had been inſtrumental upon the accompt of their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Publick Reſolutions to drive them from their ſtations. 3. To paſs by that which he ſaith, that they found by their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement, that they had given Reſolution to ſome perſons, ſeeking advice, that it was not lawful for them to continue in that ſervice, being in ſuch a conjunction as the Publick Reſolutions car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried: I take notice of what he ſets down, that the Brethren came not to <hi>Perth</hi> at the firſt Dyet appointed to them; and afterwards the Committee required them to attend at <hi>Perth</hi> or <hi>Dundee,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Kings return from <hi>Aberdeen</hi> that there might be a more full Meeting of the Committee, a great part of the moſt conſiderable Members of it being with him, how could they come at the firſt Dyet? the advertiſment being ſo exceedingly ſhort, from the time of their receipt of the Letter, to that time of their comperance; and the one of them being ſomewhat ſickly and not able to travel. The Committees appointment for them to ſtay at <hi>Perth,</hi> was before their coming, and before the Kings departure, when the Committee was full and numerous, though he doth inſinuate it to have been otherwaies; and there was a Quorum of the Committee of Eſtates ſtill at <hi>Perth</hi> after the Kings departure, who yet would not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in that buſineſs, and ſaid, They could not. The truth was, the men who were the great ſticklers in it (whom the Author calls the moſt conſiderable Members of the Committee) were abſent, and they had before their departure taken ſuch courſe that the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs ſhould not be medled with, till the Kings return from <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deen.</hi>
                           <pb n="227" facs="tcp:166443:132"/>
4. I take notice of that which he ſaith, That when the Committee of Eſtates did require the Commiſſions advice what ſhould be done with theſe Brethren, in relation to the ſecuring of the Garriſon of <hi>Sterling,</hi> That as to this they could not take on them to determine the matter, being meerly Civil; but that they deſired &amp; expected that the Committee would deal with them in tenderneſs, as being Miniſters of the Goſpel, was the buſineſs, as to the intereſt of their carriage in it, and the ground upon which they were cited, meerly Civil; Was it any other thing then the diſcharge of their conſciences in their Miniſterial functions, as Miniſters of the Congregation of <hi>Sterling</hi>? It is true, that there was ſuch a deſire of tenderneſs in the cloſe of the Commiſſions Paper, but there was ſo much ſaid in the body of it for exaggerating their carriage, that a greater puniſhment then a continued confinement might have been thought tender dealing to ſuch men. That Paper was of ſuch a nature, that not a few of theſe to whom it was given in, who were none of the greateſt friends to the Miniſters of <hi>Sterling,</hi> were not well ſatisfied therewith, if it may be beleeved what was then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently reported to theſe Miniſters at <hi>Perth,</hi> by ſome who did profeſs to know it. 5. I take notice of that which he ſpeaks upon their dimiſſion, what dealing there was by ſome of their intimate friends with Mr. <hi>Rob. Douglas</hi> and Mr. <hi>James Wood,</hi> to intercede with the Parliament, to paſs from calling them further. I do not know unleſs he mean of Mr. <hi>James Durham</hi> (who had from the begining been againſt ſuch away of proceeding with them) his dealing with theſe two, that the Parliament might not meddle fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with theſe Miniſters, but ſuffer them to go to their Charges; and though they do willingly own him as a friend, yet what he did in that particular, was not only out of reſpect to them, but alſo from reſpect to the Commiſſion, and to the Parliament, conceiving it not to be for their advantage to meddle with theſe Miniſters in ſuch a way; and though theſe Miniſters did not affect to come to a Publick Hearing before the Parl. yet would they have chuſed that and more too, rather then to wrong their conſciences in the thing whereof they were challenged: and as at their firſt appearing before the Committee of Eſtates they ſhewed themſelves ready and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give an accompt of their Doctrin and carriage in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, ſo (the Lord aſſiſting them) they would have been neither aſhamed nor afraid to have done it before the Parliament, if they
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:166443:133"/>
had been called thereunto. That Mr. <hi>Robert Douglas</hi> and Mr. <hi>James Wood</hi> did ſo readily obtain their deſire, it was a token that they had power in that particular. That one of theſe Brethren came and acknowledged to theſe two kindneſs done in their behalf, is more then that Brother doth take with. He ſaith, that he came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to Mr. <hi>Rob. Douglas</hi> and ſaid to him, that he hoped to have no cauſe to repent of what he had done: but what, ſuppoſe both of them had come to both and done ſo? That which is leſs then ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and equity, to wit, a breaking off of oppreſſion and iniquity may be acknowledged by the oppreſſed for courteſie and kindneſs without hypocriſie and diſſimulation, and it makes no bad requital nor ſlander afterwards to tell the truth how far men were acceſſory to the oppreſſing and afflicting of them.</p>

                        <p>WHat though it were true that the Commiſſion in their Act and laſt Letter to Presbytries, did reſtrain Presbytries from cenſuring any of them, yet what is that to contradict or refute what is alleadged by the Writer, That the Commiſſion did in their Warnings and Papers ſtir up Presbyteries to cenſure ſuch, and cite them to the Gen. Aſſembly: theſe are more evident truths then can be denied, and even that Act and laſt Letter doth verifie
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:166443:133"/>
that point of the Alleadgance concerning the citing of them to the Aſſembly; which Citation as it did exclude theſe who were cited, from a Vote at leaſt in that particular; ſo was it (in the nature of it) apt to obſtruct the freedom of others in voicing. He tells us, they were but few who were cited: well then, ſome there were, yea many were cited; the Synod of <hi>Perth</hi> did at one Dyet, upon the accompt of that Letter, cite, not a few of their number who were preſent, and did direct Summons to others who were abſent; the Presbytry of <hi>Jeaburgh</hi> did cite three of their number; ſundry al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the Presbytery of <hi>Glaſgow, Chyrnſide</hi> and elſe-where were cited. He repeats again his diſtinction of ſuch as differed from Publick Reſolutions, and ſuch as continued to oppoſe them; the laſt whereof only, as he inſinuates, were cited. But to paſs by the diſtinction it ſelf, (which ſeems to teach men a way that doth not ſeem well to become the Miniſters of the Goſpel, <hi>h. e.</hi> to differ in ſuch things as concerns the judgement and practice of the people committed to their charge, in matters of ſpecial intereſt to the cauſe of God, and yet to be ſilent and ceaſe to give teſtimony thereof, either for their own exoneration, or information of their People (which was one of the deſires and overtures preſt upon the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of <hi>Sterling</hi> at <hi>St. Andrews</hi>) Who ſo will look upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions Paper <hi>March</hi> 20. will find that in reference to cenſure, it takes in, not only ſuch as continue to oppoſe and move contrarily, but alſo ſuch as move not at all or move ſlowly; as well theſe who are indifferent and neutral, as theſe who oppoſe, ſee Pag. 2. &amp; 5. ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

                     <p>TO the Third Particular, concerning the Kings Letter, and the Commiſſioners Speech to the Aſſembly, there was not one word in them more or leſs for Puniſhing or Cenſuring any that Differed from the publick Reſolutions, but if any thing of that kind was deſired it was for oppoſing &amp; weakning of the hands of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and ſtrengthning the hands of the Enemy joyned with expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:166443:134"/>
of earneſt deſire to endeavour by all fair means to gain all that differed, to unity: did this take away the freedom and liberty of voycing eſpecially conſidering this which was deſired was proponed by way of meer deſire, without any threatning or alurement to be byaſſed by mens voting, but that the honeſt Reader may be able the better to give his Judgment of this matter, he may reade the Commiſſioners Speech (the Coppie of the Kings Letter I have not, but both were to one purpoſe on the matter) ſet down at the end of this Paper faithfully as it was delivered, alwayes whatever was in the Letter, I dare affirm, that in that Aſſembly, there was as great freedom and liberty in Speaking and Voting about theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions in debate, as well as in any other, as well <hi>contra</hi> as <hi>pro,</hi> as was in any Aſſembly theſe years by-paſt, yea, more then was in ſome of them, wherein it was well known, that oftentimes to the grief of men in the Kirk, moſt eminent for Grace, Gifts, Gravity, and Experience, ſome who now unadviſedly accuſes this Aſſembly of want of freedom and liberty, have endeavoured to carry mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with a ſtrong hand, cutting down with ſharp reflections, and flouting ſuch as any wayes dared to ſpeak and vote in a different way from them, which (if report may be beleeved, ſome of them hath acknowledged in their late Confeſſions.) The Writer after the propounding of the Argument, meets with one Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; We ſhall not ſtand upon the diſcuſſing of his Reply as it relates unto that Objection, but ſhall ſpeak one word to that which he chargeth upon the Kings Letter as inorderly and irregular. viz. That <hi>when as the Aſſembly had not yet medled with the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Reſolutions, to condemn and reprove them, he ſhould have ſtirred up the Aſſembly to Cenſure ſuch as differed from them.</hi> Anſw. Beſides that as hath been already ſaid, the Aſſembly was not deſired to Cenſure any for differing from the publick Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſimply. Firſt, It was not deſired that the Aſſembly ſhould cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them without any trying or approving of their reſolutions, nor was it deſired that the Aſſembly ſhould approve without due tryal, but the King ſuppoſing them to be right and juſt in themſelves, and that the Aſſembly upon due tryal finds them to be ſuch, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that ſuch as had oppoſed them (howbeit it could not be but to the prejudice of the defence of the Cauſe and Kingdom) might be dealt with to be reclaimed, or if that could not be obtained, Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured. Secondly, Conſider what a caſe he was in then, he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leidged
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:166443:134"/>
by Treaty to follow the Advice of the Commiſſion of the Kirk in the intervals of Aſſemblies in matters Eccleſiaſtick, he had ſought and gotten then Advice in theſe matters queſtioned, and no men in <hi>Scotland</hi> were more earneſt to have that Condition in the Articles of the Treaty then they who accuſes him here: But it may be he ſhould have uſed his judgment of diſcretion upon any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions given by the Commiſſion. I confeſs that is true, yet any man may perceave that the words in that Article of the Treaty are very peremtory and general in the later, for no more is ſaid, but that he ſhould follow the Advice of the Commiſſion; and it was well known when it was mentioned, that it ſhould be expreſly added, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Word of God, and Doctrine, and Conſtitutions of this Kirk: The Motion was oppoſed and ſtopped by ſome of the Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers: This I ſpeak not to ſay that he was bound to give blind obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but to ſhew that he was in a right tickliſh caſe here: But leaving this, the civil Magiſtrate being convinced in his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, upon good, true, and ſolid grounds of the Errour of ſome Doctrine, or Practice of ſome Miniſters which hath not been par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly determined in hypotheſi by the conſtitution of the Kirk, and of evil that they have done to the Publick in following it, may he not exhort one general Aſſembly being conveened even in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try thereof, to Cenſure ſuch without praelimitation, or encroching upon the liberty and freedom of the Aſſembly in judging and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon it? I doubt if he may not, but ſuppoſe he cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out encroaching and praelimitation active upon his part, yet ſure theſe can not prove the Aſſembly not free in Voting and Judging, unleſs there can be ſome evidence given of the impreſſion and effect of it on the Members in their Voting and Judging. A Judge may be tempted and ſollicited, and yet may be unqueſtionable, uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and free in his judging.</p>

                        <p>THe Author doth not deny, and I beleeve he cannot, but that the Kings Letter, and the Commiſſioners Speech, did contain ſomewhat relating to Puniſhment and Cenſure; but ſeeks a ſhift by telling us, That if any thing of that kind was, it was for Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Leavies, and weakning the hands of the Kingdom, and ſtrengthning the hands of the Enemy. If either the Letter or the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:166443:135"/>
Speech had been exhibited, they had ſpoken beſt for themſelves; none of them is ſubjoyned to that Coppy of his Vindication, which is come to my hands. But upon ſuppoſal that it was as he ſaith (of which yet he ſeems not to be very confident, and therefore after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards helps himſelf with his wonted word, <hi>That it was not for differing from the publick reſolutions ſimply or meerly</hi>) what bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is it then it was? Did not all the Aſſembly to whom that Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was written and that Speech ſpoken know, that the oppoſing of Leavies, and weakning the hands of the Kingdom, and ſtrengthning the hands of the Enemy which was meant of, was Preaching and bearing Teſtimony againſt the publick Reſolutions, neither doth it take off the difficulty. That it was joyned with expreſſions of ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire to endeavour by all fair means to gain them: Theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires could very well ſtand with incitations to Cenſures, and that whatever was the way of proponing, whether by way of meer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire (as the Author alleadges) or otherwayes, yet was it not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out threatning ſpeeches, upon the matter of which, I am content that Judgment may be given by the Letter and Speech themſelves: He dare affirm, That in Speaking &amp; Voting about theſe Reſolutions there was as great Freedom and Liberty as was in Aſſemblies theſe years paſt, yea, more then was in ſome of them, but in this he is too daring: Was there any Aſſembly theſe years paſt, that had ſo many bonds and reſtraints upon them (as we have already inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced) all that he inſtances is, That ſome of theſe who accuſes this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the want of Freedom and Liberty, have in other Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies endeavoured to carry matters with ſtrong hand, calling down with ſharp reflections, and flouting ſuch as any way dared to ſpeak and vote in a different way from them: For proof of this, he gives us, <hi>It is well known: and the acknowledgment of ſome of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their late Confeſſions.</hi> I think indeed that it is wel known that too often in moſt of our Kirk Judicatories, there was in moſt men that ſate therein, too much of a carnal Spirit, and too little of the ſober, holy, grave, ſpiritual, meek way of the holy Ghoſt: And ſome of theſe men have, as to their own carriage in Judicatories, acknowledged this, and are indeed convinced of it, before the Lord, deſiring mercy in his ſight, and grace, That if ever it ſhall be again allowed them to ſit in Judicatories, there may be more of the beauty and image of the Lord upon them, and their way. But that they cryed down ſuch with ſharp reflections, and flouting as da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:166443:135"/>
to ſpeak or vote otherwayes then they did, is that which no man is able to make good, &amp; which (I t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ow) their own conſciences doth not accuſe them of: haply ſome would have expected that the Author would have ſpared to have reflected upon theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in their confeſſions, ſeeing he is a man ſubject to the like Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that others be; and I doubt not to the ſame convictions and confeſſions upon them His defence of the Kings Letter is ſuch, that I fear ſhall ſatisfie few. 1. He repeats, that it was not therin deſired to cenſure any for differing from the publick reſolutions ſimply, to what I have ſpoken already. Next it is but a <hi>ſubterfuge,</hi> which he ſaith, That it was not deſired that the Aſſembly ſhould cenſure them without trying or approving their reſolutions; but the King ſuppoſing them to be right and juſt in themſelves, and after the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly ſhould after due triall finde them to be ſuch, deſired that ſuch as had oppoſed them (howbeit it could not be but to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the defence of the Cauſe and Kingdom) might be dealt with to be reclaimed, or if that could not be obtained, cenſured. There is nothing here for anſwering what is alleadged by the Writer, to wit, that the Aſſembly whileſt they had not yet med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the publick reſolutions, and had not found them right, were ſtirred up to cenſure theſe that could not be reclaimed from them; and taking it as the Author doth alleadge, That the King did ſuppoſe them to be right, and withall, that he ſpake nothing to the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to allow a fair hearing to theſe of a contrary minde, or to ſearch whither they were right or wrong. It ſaith that the Kings Letter did contain a clear intimation of his minde to the Aſſembly, not only in order to theſe who ſhould continue to oppoſe, or could not be reclaimed, but alſo in order to theſe who ſhould vote <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>contra</hi> in the Aſſembly; that Letter and that Speech were but an expreſſe of the Commiſsions Warnings and Acts, and Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament made there anent, in order to the furthering the execution thereof, by getting them backed with a new Act of the Aſſembly to the ſame purpoſe as afterwards they were: I cannot well decern whither the parentheſis caſt in by the Author in theſe words; <hi>how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it could not be but to the prejudice of the defence of the Cauſe and Kingdom,</hi> be cited by him as the Kings words, or interlined as his own, and therefore ſhall not give judgement of them. 2. His next defence, That the King was bound by the Treaty to follow the advice of the Commiſsion of the Kirk, in matters Eccleſiaſtick, in
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:166443:136"/>
intervalls of Aſſemblies; which he looſeth himſelf by acknowledging that he ſhould have uſed his judgement of diſcretion upon any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions given him by the Commiſsion; but becauſe the Author interlaces in order to this, ſeverall particulars; therefore in anſwer to what he ſaith in this part of his defence, I offer theſe things. Firſt, That there is nothing here ſpoken by the Author that makes for the vindication of the Kings Letter; It ſpeaks indeed to the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating, at leaſt to the excuſing of the King himſelf in writing ſuch a Letter, becauſe he was adviſed by the Commiſsions, as to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Reſolutions, but that doth not ſay, that the Letter did not contain ſuch things as were apt to hinder liberty of voting in the Aſſembly. Secondly, I acknowledge that the King was indeed in a right tickliſh condition; But who had put him in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the Authors and Abettors of the Publick Reſolutions, who after an expreſſe Article of the Treaty for removing of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants from him, and expreſſe deſires from the Generall Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and their Commiſſion renewed again and again, and expreſſe Anſwers to the Quaere proponed by himſelf, of bringing in the Malignant Party; In the negative did adviſe him to imploy and bring in that Party for his own defence, and the defence of the Cauſe and Kingdom. Thirdly, As to the peremptorineſſe of ſome to have in that condition in the Articles of the Treaty; I know it not, but though it was ſo, it was no more then his Predeceſſors was uſed to be tyed unto before the Reformation in the old Oath of Coronation, and which his own Father had condeſcended unto in the Treaty at the Bricks, as appears in the Acts of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and the Acts of Parliament 1639, and 1640. Forthly, As to the Authors quarrelling of the words of the Article as peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and generall in the Letter, becauſe no more is ſaid, but that <hi>He ſhould follow the advice of the Commiſſion</hi>; and his quarrelling ſome for oppoſing and ſtopping of a motion made by others, that it ſhould be expreſly added, <hi>agreeable to the Word of God, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Conſtitutions of this Church</hi>: He ſhould have told the circumſtances of time and place, and perſons; For my part I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe ingenuouſly, I remember no ſuch things, and others alſo who may be preſumed to know it, ſay the ſame. But let it be ſo, they did in this but adhere to the former way, which (as alſo this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle) did ſuppoſe that addition which the Author ſpeaks of, though neither Kirk nor State thought fit to expreſſe it, leſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:166443:136"/>
of jangling ſhould have been given thereby. But the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor by this his carping ſhews, that when he pleaſes, he can quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with ſome things in the Treaty, and with the Acts of Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies thereanent, as well as others; and I believe, he would think it hard meaſure to have it inferred from this, that he doth vilifie the Acts of the Aſſembly, and that his profeſſions to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Diſcipline and Conſtitutions of this Kirk, are not ſtraight nor upright: I ſhall not charge him with unfaithfulneſs, but if he was one of thoſe who was inſtructed by this Church in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at the <hi>Hague,</hi> he hath (by that which is fallen from his Pen) here furniſhed ſome occaſion to his Readers to think that he hath ſome hand in, or ſome way winked at the firſt modell of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as it was firſt ſettled and tranſacted between the King and the Commiſſioners; wherein notwithſtanding that there was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs inſtruction, that his Majeſty ſhould not onely conſent and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that all matters Eccleſiaſticall ſhould be determined by the Generall Aſsemblies, and ſuch as in the intervalls of Aſsemblies ſhould be authorized by them; but that his Majeſty in things Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick, ſhould follow the advice of the Gen. Aſſem. of this Kirk, and ſuch as ſhould be authorized by them; yet the matter was ſo tranſacted, as that theſe 2 clauſes of the Kings following the advice of the Aſsembly, &amp; ſuch as ſhould be authorized by them, and of his being content that in the Intervals betwixt Aſsemblies, things Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick ſhould be determined by ſuch as ſhould be authorized by them, were wholly left out: And if he had any hand in, or did wink at the omitting of this Article of the Treaty at the Kings Coronation: That it ſhould not be preſt upon the King to declare according thereto, albeit by the Treaty he was expreſly bound ſo to do, he would either forbear to preſs the Treaty ſo much upon others; or learn to be more tender thereof himſelf. Fourthly, as to his Queſtion, what a Civill Magiſtrate may do in a point of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine wherein he himſelf is convinced in Conſcience upon good grounds, of the error of ſome doctrine and practice of ſome Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, which hath not been particularly determined <hi>in h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I ſhall not debate, it ſeems that he himſelf doubts of it; but this was not our queſtion, the point
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:166443:137"/>
was determined by the Conſtitutions of this Kirk, and this anſwer was once given to the King by the Commiſſion of the Kirk, upon his moving the queſtion; and they did exceedingly wrong him, who by contrary Anſwers did draw him in many ſnares, and put him upon many rocks. Fifthly, as to his great anſwer of active and paſſive prelimitation, it will not ſerve him much ſtead in this particular, becauſe the Aſsembly did really vote, act and cenſure according to the deſire of that Letter, which is evidence ſufficient to prove, that the prelimitation was both active and paſſive. It is not evidence enough to prove, that a deſire hath impreſſion upon me that I grant the ſame, and do accordingly; what other proof doth the Aſsembly at <hi>Glaſgow</hi> 1638, bring to verifie the paſſive prelimiting of the Aſsembly at <hi>Glaſgow</hi> 1610, and at <hi>Pearth</hi> 1618, by the King his threatning Letters and Commandments; but this, that the Letters came to the Aſsembly, and that the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly did proceed according to the deſire thereof; will the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor admit of no proof of paſſive prelimitation, unleſs evidence can be brought from a mans own breaſt. That this very thing, and nothing elſe was the thing that weighed with him for approving the Publick Reſolutions, cenſuring the Proteſters, and laying a foundation for cenſuring all, both Miniſters and Profeſsours, that ſhould continue to oppoſe theſe Reſolutions. I cloſe this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe with the words of theſe Divines and Lawyers, cited before in the book containing their <hi>gravamina</hi> againſt the Councel of <hi>Trent: Manifeſtimum eſt Tridentinam hanc Synodum nequaquam eſſe aut dici poſſe liberum Concilium, ſed ſervum potius &amp; multis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minibus duriſſimè obſtrictum atque captivum.

                     <p>THe next Argument proper to the ſecond Paper is, becauſe in the Aſſembly at <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> perſons allowed by the Acts and Policy of this Kirk, to ſpeak their Conſciences were denyed liberty ſo to do, and to prove this, the Author taketh much pains to ſhew from eight old Aſſemblies of this Kirk, that not onely perſons Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick having calling power to vote, but others alſo are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to propone and reaſon, yea to preſent their thoughts in Writing to the Aſſembly, but he needed not to have been at ſo much pains in caſting over ſo many Aſſemblies for this purpoſe; the point is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally confeſſed in all Orthodox Kirks, and knows to all who have read the Common head <hi>De Conciliis</hi> in their Syſtems. Secondly he ſaith, that Sir <hi>Archibald Johnſtone</hi> (whom he mentions with many Encomia, to make the matter he hath to ſpeak more bulk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome) <hi>having written his minde to the Meeting, not able to come himſelf, about the matters to be agitated in the Aſſembly, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth much clear light from Scripture and Acts of former Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies in theſe particulars,</hi> (if it was much light he herd forth in ſome of theſe ſame particulart in conference at <hi>Pearth,</hi> it was but very little, and no much to be feared by any of the contrary mind) alſo <hi>the Letter was publickly delivered and required to be read by him that preſented it; the Moderator having broken it up, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to cauſe read it, and many Members did at ſundry occaſions preſs the reading of it, yet it could never be obtained, but was ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together with a Proteſtation contained therein, againſt a Paper of the Commiſsioners to the Parliam. approving what was done by the King and Committee of Eſtates to the Miniſters of Sterlin.</hi> Anſwer. Here is much want of ingenuity, and nothing of the truth of the matter making againſt the freedome of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; the Aſsembly never refuſed to have it read: Moſt part of the whole Aſsembly was earneſtly deſirous to have it read, and now more then the moſt part of theſe whom the Reader would inſinuate to be Readers unacquainted with the buſineſs, to have been the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of the reading of it, and ſmotherers of it, as being of a different judgment from Sir <hi>Archibald,</hi> and feared for the pith of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. The truth of the buſines was this, as I doubt not but the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knows in his Conſcience, had he been ſo ingenuous as to tell it
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:166443:138"/>
to ſome perſons in the Aſsembly, hearing much reſpect and tendernes to Sir <hi>Archibald,</hi> partly becauſe of intimate friendſhip with him, partly becauſe of many former good ſervices, did plead for a delay, alleadging that it was unreaſonable that the Aſsemblies precious time whereof they knew not how ſhort liberty they might have, ſhould be ſpent in reading any particular mans Letters, whereas the Committees were not as yet nominated and conſtituted, and the proceeding of the Commiſſion which (by the appointment of former Aſsemblies) ought to be the firſt buſines taken to conſideration, were not ſo much as once looked upon, and indeed the Papers which were ſent and deſired to be read concerning his minde, amounted to ſuch a volume, as the reading thereof might have taken up all the time that the Aſsembly could probably expect for ſitting, though never any other buſines had been touched. There was (if my memory fail me not) a Letter of four or five ſheets of thick Writ, and other Papers with it, required to be read before the Aſsembly did enter upon the firſt Action, the appointing of Committees, amounting to an hundred ſheets at leaſt, and muſt it be ſuch a crime as for which the Aſsembly muſt be judged null, that ſuch a motion was referred and delayed to a more convenient time, which was the onely thing the Aſſembly did, and that not of their own inclination, but upon much entreaty and pleading of ſome of his beſt wel-wiſhers in the Aſſembly, who although they alleadged the cauſe we have only mentioned in publick, yet had another cauſe of their pleading ſo earneſtly for this which they did in a private way communicate to ſome who were deſirous they ſhould be read, whereby they moved them to deſiſt from urging ſo earnestly the reading of them, not out of fear to his Papers, or diſ-reſpect to his Lordſhip, but out of meer kindnes and reſpect, becauſe <hi>viz.</hi> they did perceive by looking on them (I believe) in private ſundry high reflections againſt the Supream Powers of the Kingdom, both King and Eſtates, which could not but have brought him in preſent trouble. This is the true ſtory of that buſines, judge thou now (ingenuous Reader) impartially, if this was a conſcientious or relevant argument, to nullifie that Aſsemb. but adde to that other in the Aſsembly 48 or 49. (I did not diſtinctly remember which, but the thing is certain, and the Writer will remember better) a Paper then, concerning matters then in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate given to the Aſsembly, and deſired to be read, was publickly laid aſide and refuſed to be read, and yet the lawfulnes of that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:166443:138"/>
is not questioned. The Writer in the cloſe of this argument, would inſinuate to his Reader, that the Commiſſioners had been Authors of ſmothering theſe Papers of Sir <hi>Archibald Johnſtons,</hi> becauſe of a Proteſtation therein contained, againſt a Paper of theirs, approving what was done by the King and Committee to the Miniſters of <hi>Sterlin</hi>; but if he meaneth ſo, it is a wrongfull ſlandering of them, the Commiſſioners were far from deſiring them to be ſmothered, though one or two out of tender reſpect to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, were unwilling that he ſhould be brought in trouble by them, nor feared they his Proteſtation againſt that Paper of theirs, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which, neither he, nor any for him, could have any juſt ground of challenge; the ſumme and ſubſtance whereof was nothing elſe but a clearing of the Committees calling before them the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of <hi>Sterlin</hi> (after they had been dealt with by the Commiſsion of the Kirk about their preaching and practizing to the obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of the Leavies according to Publick Reſolutions, and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning ſome to relinquiſh their charge in the Garriſon of <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and they refuſed to deſiſt) that ſome convenient courſe might be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in relation to them, in ſecuring the Garriſon from danger from the guilt of encroaching upon the Liberties of the Kirk charged upon them by a Proteſtation of theſe Miniſters of a very high ſtrain, and together approving theſe Brethrens proteſting in ſo far as it was proviſionall for the Liberties and Priviledges of the Kirk, and expriming that theſe Brethren might be dealt with by the King and Committee in a tender and reſpectfull way as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel.</p>

                        <p>SOmetimes the Author offends when pains is not taken to prove things that are generally confeſſed, as for inſtance to prove from the Word of God, that all ſcandalous perſons ought to have been removed from the Generall Aſſembly, and here he ſeems to carp at his taking pains to prove from the policy and Acts of this Kirk, that not onely perſons Eccleſiaſtick having calling and power to vote, but others alſo are allowed to propone, hear, read and debate; yea, to preſent their thoughts in Writing to the Aſſembly: But albeit the point be generally confeſt by all Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Churches, and known to all who have read the head <hi>de Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliis</hi>
                           <pb n="240" facs="tcp:166443:139"/>
yet was it to purpoſe for the Writer to take pains to prove it from the Acts of the Aſſemblies of this Kirk, becauſe he had to do not only with theſe who are acquainted with the head <hi>de Conciliis</hi> but alſo with others who are not wel acquainted with that head, I mean ſundry Profeſſors in the Land, who had need to have the ground and relevancy of this Argument cleared unto them, and it was a nearer and more convincing way to clear it from the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Doctrine of our own Church, then from the Doctrine of other Churches. Doth not Sir <hi>Archibald Johnſtone</hi> by the teſtimony of unqueſtionable witneſſes deſerve all the commendation that is given him? Why then ſhould it be carped at, if the things that are ſaid of him be true (as they are) they do indeed make the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument more bulkſome; the Author doth once and again under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value the light held forth by him, and pith of his Papers: I ſhall not deny the Author the teſtimony of Learning and ability, and wiſhes that the Lord may more &amp; more increaſe, and more &amp; more ſanctifie it unto him, that it may be improven for the Edification of many; But there is much of a Thraſonick ſpirit that as a vein runs through all this Vindication; the man whoſe light and pith he doth ſet ſo low hath (by the Grace of God) been inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall to hold forth very much light to the Kirk of God in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in things relating to the work of Reformation, and his pith (by the power of the Lord) hath been acknowledged in both Nations. The Writer in relating of the buſineſſe of the ſmothering of Sir <hi>Archibald Johnſtons</hi> Letter, is challenged by the Author of much want of ingenuity, and ſpeaking nothing of the truth; But let us ſee how this great challenge is made out? 1. He ſaith the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly never refuſed to have it read; but was it ever read? Was not the Aſſembly often deſired to cauſe read it? Was there not often much debate about the reading of it? And was it not for a long time waved from diet to diet, &amp; at laſt buried? I fear not but this in the accompt of ingenuous men wil amount to a refuſal: But ſaith the Author, moſt part of the whole Aſſembly were earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to have it read; if it was ſo, then were there ſome few who did carry it otherwiſe, notwithſtanding of the earneſt deſires of the moſt part of the Aſſemblie, and it argues no great freedome, when the earneſt deſires of the moſt part cannot prevail to gain the reading of a Letter, becauſe of the oppoſition of ſome few, who are otherwiſe minded. He doth withall intimate unto us, That
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:166443:139"/>
none were more deſirous to have it read then the moſt part of theſe whom the Writer would inſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>uae (to be Readers unacquainted with the buſineſſe) to have been oppoſers of the Reading of it; I would ask him who were the oppoſers of the reading of it? men for the Publick Reſolutions, or men againſt them; I believe he will not deny but all the oppoſers of the Publick Reſolutions who were in the Aſſembly did earneſtly ſeek to have it read, and that all the men who oppoſed the reading of it were ſuch as were for the Publick Reſolutions, and ſome of them ſuch as did belong to the Commiſſion, and had hand in the contriving and carrying on theſe Reſolutions; this ſeems not to be denyed, but for taking off the weight off it, he comes to tell us that which he calls the truth, which he doubts not but the Writer knew in his Conſcience, had he been ſo ingenuous as to tell it; But I can anſwer him by war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from the Writer, that he concealed nothing concerning which he had any perſwaſion in his Conſcience, as to the truth of it, in that which the Author ſpeaks of: The matter alleadged by him, is that all this was from tenderneſſe and reſpect to Sir <hi>Archibald Johnſton,</hi> by ſome of his friends in the Aſſembly who did perceive by looking on his Papers ſundry high reflexions againſt the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream powers of the Kingdom, both King and Eſtates, which could not but have brought him in preſent trouble. This neceſſitates the telling more of the truth, which the Writer formerly ſpared to his own diſadvantage: The Letter was delivered to the Moderator Publickly, in the face of the Aſſembly, in the forenoon, a little after the ſitting down of the Aſſembly; upon the delivery thereof, the Moderator promiſed that it ſhould be read, and brack it open (being open in the hand of him that was Clerk to the Publick Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and was now Clerk to the Aſſembly, opportunity was given to him, and ſundry of theſe who were for the Publick Reſolutions, and were the men who oppoſed the reading of it in the Aſſembly to read it in private) after which it was preſſed to be read with much earneſtneſſe and importunity at ſeverall Diets of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and much debate there was to and fro at ſeverall occaſions about the reading of it, but the reſult was alwayes carried to a delay, untill at laſt the Proteſters leaving the Aſſembly, there was little or no more heard of it. That this was done out of meer kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and reſpect to my Lord <hi>Wariſton</hi> from whom the Letter came is not likely: 1. Becauſe not onely did he himſelf in the very bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:166443:140"/>
of it earneſtly beſeech; yea, obteſt and adjure in the Name of Chriſt, that what he wrote to the Aſſembly might be read and conſidered, but the neareſt and moſt intimate friends he hath in the world, who were like to be tender of his danger (if any) did preſſe the reading of it, I mean not onely theſe in the Aſſembly who were of his intimate acquaintance, and intimatly engaged with him in the defence of the ſame Cauſe; but alſo his own wife who came to St. <hi>Andrews</hi> of purpoſe with that Letter; and that notwithſtanding ſhe was dealt with by ſundry of theſe who were for the Publick Reſolutions to take it up, and not to preſſe the reading of it (that there might be ſome handſome ſhift for the not reading of it) refuſed to do it, and Women are known to be as tender of their husbands dangers as others. 2. The Lord <hi>Wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtons</hi> Judgement and expreſſions in all theſe things were well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough known before that time, to the King and to the Committee of Eſtates, and the reading might well have been a confirmation of the ſame thing, but would have furniſhed little or no new mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ditty 3. There were no reflections in that Letter againſt the King &amp; Committee of Eſtats, but in order to a conjunction with the Malignant party, and if the reading of theſe in the Aſſembly would have brought him preſent trouble, then ſurely it was not free nor ſafe for men who were of that opinion that the Publick Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did involve ſuch a conjunction, to ſpeak their judgement free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Aſſembly upon theſe Reſolutions, ſeeing his freedome of writing in theſe things would by the Authors own conceſſion have brought him to preſent trouble. 4. This was not the way to keep off the danger, but rather to fetch it on, becauſe it was the way to fil the Country with the noiſe of the Lord <hi>Wariſtons</hi> writing ſuch a Letter to the Aſſembly, which ſome that loved him after the delivery thereof, Publickly did ſmother and keep back from being read, notwithſtanding it was earneſtly preſt by moſt part of the Aſſembly, which report comming to the King, and to the Commiſſioners, would in all appearance have occaſioned them to call for the letter, which could not have been denyed nor put out of the way, being now publickly delivered, and ſo much debate made thereupon in the Aſſembly: But upon ſuppoſall that it was friendſhip and tender reſpect of ſome (which yet upon the former conſiderations may be juſtly doubted of, at leaſt it was all, or their moſt weighty reaſon) to the Lord <hi>Wariſton</hi>; yet to ſay nothing
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:166443:140"/>
of their being more moved with the fear of his danger, then the prejudice of the publick Cauſe, which could not but ſuffer two ways by ſmothering of the Letters and Papers therewith ſent, both by the want of the light held forth therein, and by the imputation of ſmothering of it; I wonder that the Aſſembly ſhould have been ſo eaſily moved with theſe alleadgances which he ſpeaks of, to wit, that the Aſſemblies precious time, whereof they knew not how ſhort liberty they might have, ſhould be ſpent in reading a particular mans Letter, whereas the Committees were not yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, nor the Commiſſions Proceedings which is the firſt bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe that ought to be tryed, yet looked upon, and that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers offered to be read did amount to a volume which would have taken up all the Aſſemblies time, though there had been no other buſineſſe, they being of a hundreth Sheets, and the Letter being of four or five ſheets of thick Write. There was more time ſpent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the debate of reading of the Letter, then it would have been read in to, it being not above the halfe of theſe ſheets which the Author ſpeaks of; if his teſtimony who wrote it may be believed; neither was the Aſſembly ſo much ſtraitned with time, elſe they were no good husbands of it, becauſe the firſt day they refuſed to read the Letter, they ſpent a great part of a Seſſion more then would have ſerved for reading of the Letter, debating about a Miniſters mans and his gleeb, as many honeſt witneſſes can teſtifie; and the Letter was urged and preſſed to be read, not only before, but alſo after the nominating &amp; ſetling all the Committees, both that which concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the proceedings of the Commiſſion, and all others. It was not a particular mans Letter, if by a particular man he mean a private perſon writing of buſineſſes of his own; but it was the Letter of a publick ſervant of the Aſſembly, writing of the publick buſineſſes of the Aſſembly; I mean the Clerk who was by his place bound to offer unto the Aſſemb. from their Acts &amp; Records what he knew to be contributive for clearing of their proceedings, eſpecially in bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes of common concernment of the Church; and this Letter did contain only purpoſe and buſineſſe of that nature, and nothing at all of private or perſonall concernments: Amongſt other things, there was therewith ſent an Extract of many Acts of former Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies extracted out of the Regiſters of the Kirk, contradicting the Publick Reſolutions. For the length of the other Papers, they were not ſo long, but they might have been read in a day or two at
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:166443:141"/>
moſt, or if the Aſſembly would not have read them, they might have committed them to ſome of their number to take inſpection if there was any thing therein that might contribut to give light to the Aſſembly in the matter of the Publick Reſolutions. It is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſtrange, that the Aſſembly being upon the conſideration and debate of theſe Reſolutions, whether they were agreeable to the Word of God, the ſolemn League and Covenant, the ſolemn en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement to Duties, and other Acts and Conſtitutions of the Kirk, that they ſhould have refuſed to take in conſideration, or to read what was timeouſly offered to them in the contrary, by their own Clerk; and it is more ſtrange, that notwithſtanding of this, they will in the Act wherein they approve theſe Reſolutions <hi>Preface</hi> thus, after due examination, long and much debate and mature deliberation, but muſt it (ſaith the Author) be ſuch a crime for which the Aſſembly muſt be judged null, that ſuch a motion was referred and delayed to a more convenient time. It was not a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay to a more convenient time, but a delay altogether; let the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor tell us, if he can, when that convenient time came, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Letter was not wholly laid aſide, though not by a poſitive and formall reſolution, yet waved from Diet to Diet, and never read, which is the more conſiderable, that the reading of it before the Proteſtation being ſo much urged, and the Proteſtation contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reaſons againſt the unlawfulneſſe of the Aſſembly, becauſe of the want of freedome; yet even after that the Aſſembly went on, and approved the Commiſſioners Proceedings, without reading of that Letter, whatever the Author make of it; I doubt all circumſtances being conſidered, if ſuch an inſtance can be given in any free Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, the refuſing to read former Acts and conſtitutions of Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and other things timeouſly offered unto them from the word of God, and the Covenant and Publick Papers of the Kirk by their own Clerk out of their own Regiſters for clearing of the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons proceedings which were now in debate, and if the term of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſall pleaſe not the Author, the Aſſemblies proceeding to ratifie the procedings of the Commiſſion, without reading or taking in conſideration theſe things offered unto them by their own Clerk, out of the Word of God, and their own Regiſters for clearing of theſe proceedings, notwithſtanding that the ſame was timeouſly offered, and earneſtly preſſed by many members of the Aſſembly, and promiſed by the Moderator to be read; I believe common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

As to that inſtance gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Author of a Paper laid aſide in the Aſſembly 48. or 49. The Writer ſaith, that he is ſo far from remembring it well, that he doth not remember it at all; neither yet doth others whoſe memories are better then his; Its ſtrange that the Author ſhould know it for certain, and yet ſhould neither know what Aſſembly it was, not what the buſineſſe was, nor who the perſons were; yet becauſe he affirms it for certain, I ſhal not deny it, nor ſay that it is untrue, but till he tell us the particular circumſtantiat caſe, and make it to appear that it is a paralel of the caſe now in queſtion; I think he wil alow us not to lay weight upon it. Before he cloſe his Anſwer to this Argument, he labours to Vindicate the Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners from being Authors of ſmothering a Paper of Sir <hi>Archibald Jonſtons,</hi> becauſe of a Proteſtation therein contained, againſt a Paper of theirs, approving what was done by the King and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee or Eſtates againſt the Miniſters of <hi>Sterline,</hi> and tells if the Writer meant ſo, it is a wrongfull ſlandering of them: The Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath ſaid nothing that may import that which the Author cals a ſlander: He thinks that it is inſinuate; but I think he hath more inſinuated it himſelf, whileſt he ſaith the Commiſsioners were far from deſiring them to be ſmothered, though one or two out of tender reſpect to his Lordſhip were unwilling that he ſhould be brought to trouble. But was there any thing in that Proteſtation that would have brought him in trouble? I think it will not be alleadged; why then ſhould that have been ſmothered, where even the reaſon which is alleadged to have been the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſmothering theſe Papers did fail? VVhat ground of challenge there was againſt the Commiſsions Paper doth not properly belong to this debate, and I ſhal not now meddle much with it, but leave it to the Miniſters of <hi>Sterlin</hi> whom it doth concern; yet did ſome ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious men, even ſome of thoſe of the Civill Judicatory to whom it was given in, think that the Commiſsion had gone too far there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, to give wound to the liberties of the Kirk in theſe things, which many worthy faithfull Miniſters of this Kirk have been zealous to maintain and ſuffer for; I mean refuſing to ſubject Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:166443:142"/>
Doctrine to the Civill Magiſtrate as the proper and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate judge thereof; He gives the ſumme of that Paper in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars: The firſt is the clearing of the Committees calling before them the Miniſters of <hi>Sterlin</hi>; he ſhould have ſaid the Committees citing and confining of them becauſe of their Preaching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Publick Reſolutions; and that before they were cited and ſentenced, by any other Judicatories of the Kirk; yea, before there was (by the Authors confeſsion) any determination of the Church in that particular caſe; yea, when there was clear and poſitive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations of the Church upon their ſide, and Acts binding them (under the pain of cenſure) not to be ſilent, nor to ſpeak ambiguouſly, but to bear teſtimony againſt ſuch courſes, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by the Oath of God in the Covenant, they were bound to reveal and make known. As to that practiſing of the obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Leavies, which he ſo frequently mentions, he would tell what it was beyond the bounds of their Calling, left his Readers think that he would fain have them to believe ſomewhat of theſe Miniſters, that did not become the Miniſters of the Goſpel, but cannot tell what it is. He ſaith, that the end why they were called, was, That ſome convenient courſe might be taken in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them, and ſecuring the Garriſon from danger, but hath not told us what that convenient courſe was, or could have been; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (I think) can he tell us, but by juſtifying the courſe that was taken, that is, the detaining of theſe Miniſters from their charges by Confinement. What convenient courſe could the Committee of Eſtates take in order to theſe Miniſters, in an orderly way for preventing any pretended or apprehended danger that was like to come to the Garriſon by their preaching, they having now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared themſelves that they could not, but for the diſcharging of their conſciences, continue to give warning againſt the ſinfulnes of theſe reſolutions; they could not ſentence them with any Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick cenſure, &amp; to confine or impriſon upon points of their doctrin and Minieſtriall Calling, without any Eccleſiaſtick proceſſe going before in a Kirk ſettled in her Judicatories, Government and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. I know not if the Author will juſtifie it as orderly, The next thing done in the Paper was, to vindicate the Committee from the guilt of encroaching on the Liberties of the Church, charged upon them by a Proteſtation of theſe Miniſters, which (as he alleadges) was of a very high ſtrain. I confeſs that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:166443:142"/>
was concerned to endeavour the vindication of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, becauſe they were acceſſory to what was done, as we have ſhewed before; but how they have acquitted themſelves in that Vindication, ſhall not now be inſiſted upon, neither yet the ſtrain of the Proteſtation, which is no higher then the truth will bear; but to make up all that Paper, did alſo approve theſe Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns Proteſting, in ſo far as it was proviſionall for the Liberties and the expreſſe deſires that theſe Brethren might be reſpectfully uſed as Miniſters of the Goſpel. To which I ſhall ſay nothing, but leave to theſe that can have opportunity to read that Paper, and then they will be beſt able to judge what that approbation was, and what arguments are uſed in the body of the Paper for enforcing the deſire in the Concluſion concerning their uſage.</p>

                     <p>THe laſt Argument is, that it cannot be a lawfull free Aſſembly in which perſons under tryall are admitted to ſit as judges in the ſame thing for which they are under tryall: But the Meeting at <hi>St. Andrews</hi> and <hi>Dundee</hi> was ſuch, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsioners therein were admitted to ſit as judges in the ſelf ſame things for which they were under tryal: This is abſolutly denyed, but the Writer goes about to prove it by the inſtance of ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars: <hi>1.</hi> Becauſe the Commiſsioners before the approbation of their Proceedidgs, did ſit as judges of the Proteſtation, a part whereof was, that their Proceedings ſhould not be ratified, becauſe they did involve a conjunction with the Malignant party, contrary to, &amp;c. <hi>2.</hi> They did alſo before the approbation of their Proceedings judge the perſons who had given it in, and did give their votes amongſt others, who of them ſhould be cited in order to cenſure. <hi>3.</hi> Nay the Committee wherein that buſineſſe relating to the Proteſtation and in giving of advice was handled, was for the moſt part of it made up of Members of the Commiſsion, which thing will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged we believe (ſaith he) by indifferent men very unſuitable and unconſiſtent with the liberty of a free Generall Aſſembly, and then he addeth, that neither would he have others, nor do they themſelvs lay much weight upon this argument, unleſſe two points of fact upon which it is grounded be found true: Firſt, that the Proteſtation was judged, and the five Members (it is yet queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable whether they were Members or not; their Commiſsion
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:166443:143"/>
being controverted, unleſſe he thinks them eſſentially members) were appointed to be cited before the approving of the Commiſsion of the Kirk. Secondly, that the members of the Commiſsion had voice in theſe things, inſinuating, that if theſe matters of fact be clear, as they were informed; the Argument is voted to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter down that Aſſembly, as not free, and as null. <hi>Anſwer:</hi> It is true theſe five perſons were appointed to be cited before the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the Proceedings of the Commiſsion, but not in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to cenſure, abſolutly and peremptorily; but to anſwer for their deed of Proteſting, and in caſe they ſhould not juſtifie it, or paſſe from it to be cenſured; whether the Proteſtation it ſelf was judged before the approbation of the Commiſsion, my memory ſerveth me not to ſay poſitively, I ſuppoſe it was, yet let it be clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Minutes of the Aſſembly; but give me leave to ſay it humbly, that granting both theſe matters of fact, yet the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be found by any indifferent judicious man in the world, able to bear little weight, and in effect but a meer paralogiſme in the whole probation of the Aſſumption, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners did fit Judges in the very thing in which they were under try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: For as to the firſt particular, might not the Aſſembly have judged the Proteſtation before the approbation of the Commiſſion, and yet in judging of it, not have judged the matter wherein the Commiſſioners were yet under tryall: yea verily they might; for why? they might as to that part of it, that is alleadged in this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Commiſſioners proceedings ſhould not be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, have judged that they ſhould go on to try them, and if they did find them right and agreeable to the Word of God, and the Conſtitutions of this Kirk in that caſe to ratifie them; and I dare take it upon me, that if they did judge the Proteſtation before the approbation of the Commiſſion, they did no other thing in relation to that particular. Now to judge that they ſhould go on in the tryall of the proceedings of the Commiſſion to approve them as it ſhould be found, as ſaid is, and to judge in the thing wherein the Commiſſion was under tryall, to judge upon the proceedings, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were agreeable, as ſaid is, or not, in themſelves, are not the ſame but very different things, as any that hath half an eye may ſee and decern. And did not the Members of the Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 48. judge and vote with others, that that Aſſembly ſhould go on in trying the proceedings, ratifie them if they ſhould be found right
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:166443:143"/>
and yet will he not ſay for that, nor can it in truth be ſaid, that they judged and voted in that thing wherein they were under tryall; and therefore it is evident, the Commiſsioners might ſit as Judges of the Proteſtation, even before the approbation of their proceedings, and yet it no wayes followes they did as Judges in the ſame thing wherein they were under tryall, whether the Writer hath reaſoned thus looſely out of miſtake, or on purpoſe, I cannot tell, I can hardly ſuppoſe the former of them, conſidering that this Paper evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences he is no child, if the latter be true, he hath ſure promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf very undecerning Readers, and his carriage is the more foul. To the ſecond, the Commiſsioners might alſo have given vote with others, who of the Proteſters ſhould be cited and judged them alſo, and that before the approbation of their own proceedings, and yet ſo as it could follow no ways that they had ſitten as judges in the ſame, wherein they were under tryall, <hi>i.e.</hi> their own proceedings: for why they might have voted with others, &amp; they did in no other maner of ways vote in the matter of theſe perſons citation, but that they ſhould be cited to anſwer and be tryed upon the grounds of the Proteſtation, and they might alſo with others judge the grounds of the Proteſtation, and found them not relevant, and thereupon ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced them for proteſting and declining the Generall Aſſembly upon ſuch grounds, and yet the Aſſembly might have found upon tryall the proceedings of the Commiſsion afterward wrong and cenſurable without any contradiction. There is not a ground of the Proteſtation, but it might have been found non-relevant for proteſting againſt the Aſſembly, before the tryall of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions proceedings, and yet nothing being thereby imported more for approbation then for condemnation of the proceedings of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion. As to the third particular, the force of it fals to the ground with the two former, for it containeth no new grounds, but only a ſeeming aggravation of them, if they might ſit in the Aſſembly <hi>in plenâ Curiâ,</hi> and judge deciſivè, they might as well in a Committee both deliberative and praeparatoriè, In theſe matters, <hi>viz.</hi> upon the Proteſtation and Proteſters, and yet not judge any thing in the thing wherein themſelves were under tryall, nor yet done any thing therein that could be any prejudice for approving or diſ-approving of their own proceedings. Nay, I dare affirm it, that neither the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor any that was in the Aſſembly, ſhall be able to inſtance, that any of the Commiſsioners did judge or vote either in the Aſſembly, or any Committee of the Aſsembly, or any Act of it importing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:166443:144"/>
formally, or by way of conſequence, approbation or continuance of their own proceedings. I ſhall here but adde one word that any of the Commiſſioners did vote in the Aſsembly in the matter relating to the perſons of the Proteſters, or were on any Committee for that purpoſe: It was not their prejudice or to their advantage, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thing well known, I believe, to their own conſciences, that ſome of theſe Commiſsioners were perſons moſt tenderly affected towards them of any, and ſo did carry themſelves. Now I leave it to the impartiall underſtanding Reader to be judged if this laſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the Aſſembly is able to bear much weight, give it all the props the Writer requireth to ſuſtain it.</p>

                        <p>THe Author in his Anſwer to this Argument, doth not deny any of theſe two particulars in the matter of fact, the truth whereof was acknowledged as neceſſary by the Writer for laying weight on the Argument, to wit, that the Proteſtation was judged and condemned, and the five Member, appointed to be cited before the approving of the Commiſſion-Book; and that the Members of the Commiſſion had vote in theſe things; But yeelding both, he doth juſtifie what was done as juſt and orderly; For my pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>t, I wonder of the Commiſſions modeſty, and of the Aſſemblies wiſdome in it, that needleſly would put themſelves upon theſe rocks, which have ſo uncomely a fronticepiece, that I doubt exceedingly if either the Author, or any man elſe when they have exerciſed their ingines to the utmoſt, ſhall ever be able to vindicate it from the appearance of evill, to ſay no more. But let us hear his anſwer to the particulars inſtanced by the Writer. It is true (ſaith he) that theſe five Members were appointed to be cited, before the approbation of the proceedings of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but not in relation to cenſure abſolutely and peremptorily; but to anſwer for their deed of proteſting, and in caſe they ſhould not juſtifie it, or paſſe from it, to be cenſured. To which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn firſt; 1. To paſs by the debates that were previous to the citation concerning ſummar Excommunication, wherein (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) the Commiſsioners ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e as Judges as well as others. The citation was in relation to cenſure abſolutely, as appeared not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the tenor of the ſummonds, which hath no ſuch caveats and proviſoes in it, as the Author ſpeaks of, but alſo from this, that the Proteſtation was judged and condemned to be a crime
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:166443:144"/>
before iſſuing of the ſummonds; and therefore the Author hath through inadvertence or willingly miſtaken, when he inſinuates, that there was place left for defending or juſtifying of their deed when they ſhould compear. It were a ſtrange method of proceeding, if the Commiſsion ſhould firſt condemn their deed, before hearing of what they had to ſay for juſtifying of it, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards cite them in order to cenſure, yet with this <hi>proviſo,</hi> that they would hear them to juſtifie their deed; and it is little to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that they might paſſe from it, their paſsing from it did not ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>em them from cenſure, unleſs it had been <hi>ex gratia,</hi> and by the mercy of their Judge; But upon ſuppoſall that the ſummonds had not been peremptory for cenſure, what is that to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to refute what is alleadged by the Writer, that the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners were not Judges of the Proteſters, before the approving of their proceedings. Is it not <hi>ejuſdem citare &amp; ſententiam ferre</hi>? And did not their voice in the citation of the perſons of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever nature it was irrefragably ſay, that they might warrantably be Judges of their cenſure. It ſeems the Author ſaw ſomwhat of this, &amp; therfore afterwards he anſwers, that the Commiſsioners might have given vote with others, who of the Proteſters ſhould be ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and judged them alſo; and that before the approbation of their own proceedings, and yet ſo as it could follow in no wayes, That they had ſitten as Judges in the ſame thing wherein they were under tryall, <hi>i. e.</hi> their own proceedings; for why (ſaith he) they might have voted with others, (and they did no other manner of way vote in the matter of theſe perſons citation) but that they ſhould be cited to anſwer and be tryed upon the grounds of the Proteſtation, and found them not relevant, and thereupon ſentenced them for proteſting and declining the Generall Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly upon ſuch grounds, and yet the Aſſembly might have found upon tryall, the proceedings of the Commiſſion afterward wrong and cenſurable, without any contradiction: for why, if we will believe the Author, there is not one ground of the Proteſtation, but it might have been found not relevant for proteſting againſt the Aſſembly, before the tryall of the Commiſſions proceedings, and yet nothing been thereby imported, more for approbation then for condemnation of the proceedings of the Commiſſion. To theſe things I have anſwered before; but becauſe the Author is pleaſed to repeat them, I ſhall firſt offer an argument for proving that the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſsioners by judging of the Proteſtation, were Judges
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:166443:145"/>
of their own proceedings, and then another Argument for proving that the condemning of their Proteſtation could not wel ſtand with the condemning of their proceedings. The Firſt Argument is, who ſo judges upon the irrelevancy of the Exceptions grounded upon their own proceedings; Judges of their own proceedings: But the Commiſſioners in judging of the Proteſtation, did judge of the irrelevancy of Exceptions grounded upon their own procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, <hi>Ergo.</hi> in judging of the Proteſtation they judged of their own proceedings. The Second Propoſition, I hope, will not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, becauſe the Proteſtation could not be judged irrelevant but by judging of the Exceptions propounded againſt the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners irrelevant, as the Author himſelf did formerly acknowledge; and that theſe Exceptions were grounded upon theſe proceedings is manifeſt: the exception of prelimiting of the Aſſembly being grounded upon thair Letter and Act ſent to Presbytries which was a part of their proceedings; and the Exception of their being ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous being grounded upon the publick Reſolutions which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother part of their proceedings. The firſt Propoſition ſeems to be cleer from the intimat connexion, that is, betwixt the one and the other of which the Author himſelf gave a hint before: But I prove it thus, Who ſo judgeth of the irrelevancy of Exceptions grounded on their own proceedings muſt find theſe exceptions irrelevant, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe they have no weight in law as not being contrary but conſonant to the law, or not as yet being determined by the law, or elſe becauſe they are not true, or the truth of them, not being yet made to appear, but they cannot judge of any of theſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out judging of their own proceedings, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. The buſineſſe ſhall be cleer by applying it to the things in hand: There is one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception proponed in the Aſſembly againſt the Commiſſioners, That they are ſcandalous, becauſe of carrying on a courſe of Defection in publick Reſolutions: This exception is by the Commiſsioners themſelvs together with the reſt of the Aſſembly judged irrelevant; now I deſire to know upon what ground, either becauſe to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on ſuch a courſe in the publick Reſolutions is no relevant ground to make men ſcandalous; and if ſo, either becauſe theſe procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings are not contrary to the Law, or elſe becauſe they are not yet determined in law, or if they judge it irrelevant in reference to the Fact, it muſt be either becauſe they judge the Fact falſe, or elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they judge it not yet proven; ſo that take it what way we will, it ſtill follows that they paſſed judgement upon theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:166443:145"/>
after that judgment, theſe proceedings are not contrary to the Law: or thus, theſe proceedings are not yet determined by the Law: or thus, theſe proceedings are falſe in fact: or thus, theſe proceedings are not yet proven to be true in fact, and therefore the Exception founded upon them is not relevant to look upon the Commiſsioners as under a ſcandal, ſo alſo in application to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception proponed againſt them becauſe of the prelimiting of the Aſſembly by their Letter and Act; That exception is judged irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levant by themſelves and others, either becauſe there was no ſuch Letter and Act to be found among their proceedings: or becauſe ſuch a Letter and Act did include no prelimitation but ſuch as agrees to law: or elſe becauſe it is not yet determined as to the point of law, or not proven as to the matter of fact: and ſo take it what way we will, it ſtill includes a judgment upon the proceedings, for which they are under tryal. The Argument which I offer for proving of the other Point, is this, Who ſo once judges the Commiſſioners proceedings to be conſonant unto, or not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Law according to which they ought to be tryed and judged, cannot afterwards condemn the ſame proceedings, or find them wrong: But who ſo judges theſe Exceptions proponed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their proceedings to be irrelevant, judges theſe proceedings to be conſonant unto, or not to be condemned by the law accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which they ought to be judged. <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> The Firſt Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition ſeems clear and undeniable: The Second is proven, becauſe Exceptions that are proponed upon matters of fact that are true &amp; manifeſt as to the exiſtence of them, cannot be found irrelevant but upon one of theſe two grounds; either becauſe theſe Facts are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to the law, or not condemned by the law, and what is once found by the Judge to be conſonant to the law, or not condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the law, cannot be afterwards (unleſs we would make him judge contrary judgment) found to be wrong, becauſe what is wrong is contrary to the law. The application of the Argument may help the Reader to the clear underſtanding of it, when the Commiſſioners with other Members of the Aſſembly, by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the Proteſtation, Judges and Condemns the Exceptions contained therein as irrelevant, they muſt upon ſuppoſal of the truth of the Facts which are manifeſt and acknowledged, find theſe Exceptions irrelevant, either becauſe, theſe Facts upon which they are founded, are conſonant to the law by which they are to be
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:166443:146"/>
judged; to wit The Word of God, and Acts of the General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly. or becauſe they are not condemned therby: If they judge them conſonant to the law, they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not afterwards find them wrong by that law, becauſe they have already by the ſame law found them right; If not condemned, neither can they find them wrong, becauſe that were to find them condemned by the law, by which they have already found them not condemned. If it be ſaid, which for any thing my weakneſs reaches, is the only thing that can with any colour be ſaid. That they might find theſe Facts as to the relevancy or irrelevancy of them not condemned, nor determined by any Act of any General Aſſembly, and ſo no grounds of relevant Exception, when they were offered unto the Aſſembly, and yet might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards find them condemned by the Word of God, and ſo find them wrong. I return, 1. That by this Anſwer it is granted, That theſe could never be found wrong by any Act of the Aſſembly, which then was in being. 2. That the Commiſſioners and the Aſſembly when they judged of them in order to the relevancy of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception founded upon them, did not only neglect to give a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on them according to the juſt and infalible rule, by which they are bound in the firſt place, and by their oath, to ſquare all their proceedings, to wit, the Word of God; but alſo gave a judgment of them contrary to the Word of God, to wit. That they were not relevant grounds of Exceptions, which is a judgment contrary to the Word, becauſe the things being in themſelves wrong by the Word, cannot but be relevant grounds of Exception. If it be ſaid, That all that they judged was that it was not yet manifeſt by the Word that they were relevant grounds of Exception; That ſtill i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> but a poor ſhift to defend an ill Cauſe, becauſe this follows, That they did condemn them, before they knew whither the Word of God did condemn them, or approve them: and this is indeed to my underſtanding the up-ſhot of the buſineſs, That it muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be yeelded that the condemning of theſe Exceptions, was the approving of theſe proceedings, or elſe that men in condemning of them, went on blindly, not knowing whether they did therin judge according to the Word of God, or againſt it; Becauſe what I have already ſaid, doth cleer and take in what is material and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to this buſineſſe: Therefore I ſhall be the ſho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ter upon his Anſwers to the other two Particulars mentioned by the Writer: He doth not deny, but the Proteſtatian was judged before the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:166443:146"/>
of the Commiſſioners proceedings: and ſurely if ſo, this was no handſome work, not only becauſe the Commiſsioners ſate as Judges to condemn the Exceptions propounded againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: but alſo becauſe a part of the Proteſtation was that the Commiſſioners proceedings ſhould not be approven as involving a conjunction with the malignant party &amp;c. And it is ſomwhat ſtrang that they ſhould condemn a Proteſtation againſt the approving of theſe Reſolutions before they find theſe Reſolutions approvable: &amp; that the men who were under tryal in order to theſe Reſolutions, ſhould ſit as Judges, in condemning a Proteſtation againſt the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of them. The Author thinks, that the Argument will be found by any indifferent judicious men in the World, to bear little weight, and to be a meer Paralogiſm in the whole probation of the aſſumption; to win, That the Commiſſioners did ſit as Judges in the very thing for which they were under tryal: I hope before this time judicious men may ſee ſomething in it that will bear weight, and that there is no Paralogiſm in the probation of the aſſumption.

That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners proceedings ſhould not be ratified, have judged that they ſhould go on to try them, and if they did find them right and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Word of God and Conſtitutions in this Kirk, in that caſe to ratify them; whether they might have done this is not now the Debate: It ſeems by what is ſaid, That they could not have done it, but he dare take it on him, That if they did judge the Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, before the approbation of the Commiſſion, they did no other thing in relation to that particular: Now ſaith he, that they ſhould go on in the tryal of the Commiſſions to approve them if it ſhould be found as ſaid is, and to judge in the thing wherin the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was under tryal, &amp;c. are not the ſame, but very different things, as any man that hath half an eye may ſee and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:166443:147"/>
Aſſembly, leaving a reſerve for the other part, againſt the ratifying of the Commiſſions proceedings, until theſe proceedings ſhould be tryed: but I cannot take this for granted, until he verify it by the Act it ſelf, which doth condem the Proteſtation, whereof I doubt exceedingly if it do contain any ſuch limitation; if it had, it is like that he would have told us directly of it, but upon ſuppoſal that it did, yet that doth not take off the difficulty, nor Anſwer the Argument, becauſe as we have already ſhewen, the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſioners, by judging the relevancy of the exception proponed againſt themſelves (which they judged of, when they condemned the firſt part of the Proteſtation, againſt the lawfulnes &amp; freedom of the Aſſemb.) they judged their own proceedings, wherof no ſuch inſtance can be given either in the 48. or any other lawful free Aſſem. of this Kirk, As to that of the 48. we have often ſhewed that in al that buſines he goes upon miſtakes, to wit, That the Parliament did except againſt ſuch Members of the Aſſembly as were Members of the Comiſſion. As to his judgment of the Writers reaſoning, it is ſuch as doth make it appear, that he had rather chuſe to allow to him the teſtimony of ſome ability, then not to faſten the imputation of a foul miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age upon him; For he ſaith he cannot tell whether the VVriter hath reaſoned this looſly out of miſtake, or of purpoſe; he can hardly ſuppoſe the former, conſidering this Paper evidences that he is no Child: If the latter be true, he hath ſurely promiſed himſelf very undecerning Readers, and his carriage is the more foul. It ſeems the Authors judgement of the Writer towards the end of his Vindication differs a little from what it was of him not far from the begining of it, or elſe he ſpeaks of him ſo as may contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute moſt for making him contemptible. There he brings him in as one that in the pening of his Paper muſt have the help of others, for the School and for the Law of it, that he may be looked upon as a weak man, and here he ſtiles him as one that is no Child, that he may be looked upon as a Sophiſter: But I beleeve the Writer will rather chuſe rather to be accompted weak, then wicked; rather a Child, then a Deceiver; and he hath upon this accompt, and upon the accompt of his own inocency in this particular, warranted me to tell the Author, and all others who reads theſe Debates, That if in the proof of the <hi>minor</hi> of this Argument (that the Commiſſioners ſit as Judges in their own proceedings) he hath reaſoned looſly, he hath the teſtimony of his own conſcience bearing witneſs to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrety,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:166443:147"/>
that he hath not done it of purpoſe, but out of miſtake; not wilfully, but in ſimplicity; and withal, that he is ſo far from being convinced of any miſtake in this, by any thing that is yet ſaid, that he is more and more cleared and confirmed that they did ſit as Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in their own proceedings, for which they were under trial, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of any thing that is ſaid by the Author for clearing of them; but of this I leave the judgment to the Readers. As to the third particular, I acknowledge, that if the other two had been ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyingly anſwered, the force of it would have fallen to the ground, it being indeed but an aggravation of the former; yet ſuch an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation as adds not a little weight to it; for all men know what influence the preparations and deliberations of Committees have upon the Judicatories, whoſe Committees they are. But theſe two particulars being eſtabliſhed, and it being true (as it is not denied by the Author himſelf) that the Committee wherein the Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that which concerned the citing of the Proteſters was han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, was for moſt part made up of theſe, who had been Members of the Commiſſion; no queſtion they had in all this buſineſs a great influence upon the determination of the Aſſembly, and did bring a prejudice to the judgment, relating to their own proceedings, yea did that, that did involve an approbation of their proceedings, at leaſt a judgment that they could not be condemned or found irrelevant; and therefore the Author dares to affirm too much, when he ſaith, That he dare affirm it that neither the Writer nor any that were in the Aſſembly ſhall inſtance, that the Commiſſioners did ſit and vote either in the Aſſembly, or in any Committee of the Aſſembly, or any Act of it importing either formally, or by way of conſequence, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation or condemnation of their own proceedings; we having made the contrary to appear, what was the carriage of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners in theſe things that paſt in the Aſſembly towards the Proteſters, whether their voting and judging in that matter was to their prejudice or diſadvantage; if he mean in order to cenſure I do not know, as never having had the opportunity to be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly informed about it; I do indeed beleeve that ſome of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners were tender, as to the matter of cenſures, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the cenſure, and of the number of perſons who were to be picked out for cenſure; But to ſay nothing that all of them were not ſo, and for any thing I know none of them were free of laying the ground of their cenſure <hi>h. e.</hi> of
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:166443:148"/>
condemning the Proteſtation, and declaring it to be cenſurable, it doth not contribute any thing, for anſwering of the thing that was objected, that is, that they were admitted to ſit as Judges of their own proceedings, for which they were under trial; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore notwithſtanding this, or any thing that is ſaid to the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it ſtill hath weight againſt the Aſſembly, of which I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that all impartial underſtanding Readers ſhould judge: I do in reference to this Argumenr, and the Argument of pre-limitation, and that of the rejecting of the Exceptions propounded againſt the Commiſſioners cloſe with the words of theſe Divines and Lawyers in their Greivances againſt the Councel of <hi>Trent, Quale vero hoc Concilium futurum ſit, aut quid tandem libero Concilio ſimile ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biturum, in quo litigatorum altera pars, &amp; quidem rea, cum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſortibus eodem judicio perſonam judicis quo<expan>

been ſaid, and then to give ſentence whether the Reaſons contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Proteſtation, and in the latter Papers, be not relevant grounds, to proteſt againſt &amp; to nullify the late Aſſembly as unfree and unlawful in the Conſtitution &amp; manner of proceeding; &amp; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Writer had not reaſon to affirm, that there was ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments upon the Conſtitution thereof, and right manner of proceeding therein, as did deſtroy almoſt all the eſſential requiſits of a free Aſſembly; freedom of Election, free Voting, free acceſs and receſs, free hearing of what was offered for light, impartial hearing and diſcuſſing of Exceptions againſt Conſtituent Members; admitting of Presbytries, who were under trial, to ſit as Judges upon particulars relating to themſelves: and whether there was not ſuch encroachments as moved the Aſſembly 38. becauſe of the like to judge ſeveral of the former Aſſemblies to be null; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtronger Reaſons are brought for nullifying any of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Aſſemblies then of this. The Author thinks theſe to be too bold Aſſertions in the Writer: but I hope they are not more bold then true; and <hi>viritas non quaerit angulos.</hi> That the Writer did not make any particular paralel of the Reaſons of the nullity of this Aſſembly, with the Reaſons of the nullity of theſe Aſſemblies, was upon no ſuch politick principle as the Author inſinuats, to wit, The fear of wronging his credit, or the diſcovering of the raſhneſs of his Aſſertion; but to ſpare (as I conceive he thought) needleſs pains, the Acts of the Aſſembly being ſo common, and the paralel being ſo eaſie to every Reader of ordinary capacity and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: and if it was a fault in the VVriter, not to make a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar paralel, faithfully comparing the one with the other, and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reaſon with Reaſon; the Author can much leſs be blameleſs who ſeems to undertake it, and yet doth little as to the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, only he makes a ſhort recapitulation of the Reaſons of the nullity of theſe Aſſemblies, and leaves the Reader to make the paralel &amp; compariſon; and in this, what hath he done more then the Writer? except that he hath been at the pains to make ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend of theſe Reaſons, which are more clearly ſet down in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Acts that are common. It is to be marked, that it is not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by the VVriter, that all the Reaſons brought for anulling of all, and every one of theſe Aſſemblies, are quadrant to this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; but that there is none of theſe Aſſemblies, for the nullify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which ſtronger reaſons are brought, and therefore though
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:166443:149"/>
ſome breaches of the right Rules of Conſtitution may haply be found in ſome of theſe Aſſemblies, which are not inſtanced in this Aſſembly, it makes nothing againſt this Aſſertion, nor for juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Aſſembly more then theſe, becauſe there is none of theſe in which moe or more weighty breaches of the Rules of Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be found, then can be found in this. But let us take a view of the moſt conſiderable Reaſons brought for nullifying theſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>, and compare them with the Reaſons which are brought for nullifying this: the firſt is, The want of timous indiction which cauſed the abſence of many Commiſſioners. To this there was ſomething equivalent in this Aſſembly that cauſed the abſence of many Commiſſioners, to wit, The troubles of the times which in ſome places hindred the Elections, and in others hindred the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners from coming. The ſecond is, want of freedom in the Election of Commiſsioners in Presbyteries, becauſe of Letters from the King and the Prelats, requiring them to chuſe ſuch and ſuch. To which was equivalent in this Aſſembly, the pre limiting of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of their freedom by the Letter and Act of the Commiſſion, excluding all thoſe who were oppoſit to the Publick Reſolutions. The third is, the admitting many to voice in the Aſſemblies, who had no Calling nor Commiſſion ſo to do; to which is equivalent in this Aſſembly, the admitting the Commiſsioners to voice, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of juſt Exceptions proponed againſt them, before the diſcuſsing of theſe Exceptions, and the admitting them to voice in the diſcuſſing of them. The fourth is, the want of freedom in voicing, becauſe of threatnings under no leſs pains then the wrath of Authority, Impriſonment, deprivation of Miniſters, &amp;c. To which was equivalent in this Aſſembly, the Kings Letter, and the Commiſſioners Speech, with the previous warnings, Remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Letters and Acts of the Commiſsion characterizing thoſe who were againſt Publick Reſolutions as Malignants, and appointing them to be cenſured, and ſtirring up the Civil Magiſtrate againſt them, together with the Acts of Parliament made againſt ſuch, which Acts did involve more and more certainly againſt the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of Publick Reſolutions then any of theſe threatnings could do, becauſe there was no Law, as yet, for executing of them. The fifth is, the practiſing ſome of the Articles concluded in theſe Aſſemblies before the Aſſembly it ſelf, notwithſtanding that theſe Articles were formerly condemned by the Church, by which their Voices
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:166443:150"/>
were pre-judged by the practice or theſe Articles before condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Church, and therefore they ſhould have been ſeclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from voicing. To which in this Aſſembly is equivalent, the practiſing the Publick Reſolutions by many Members of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly before the Aſſembly concluded the ſame, notwithſtanding they were before that time clearly condemned by the Church: I dare ſay as clearly as ever kneeling at the Communion, or feaſtval-daies, were condemned by this Church, before the Aſſembly did conclude them to be practiſed. The ſixth is, the limiting of Commiſsioners of their power and Commiſsion given unto them by their Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, which was alſo done upon the matter by Presbytries, ſending Commiſsioners to this Aſſembly: For beſides that many Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, in obedience to the Letter and Act of the Commiſsion, did chuſe none but ſuch as was for the Publick Reſolutions paſſing by all ſuch as were againſt them: ſo ſome Presbytries did expreſly diſcharge ſome who were choſen becauſe they were oppoſit to the Publick Reſolutions; of which I have given two clear inſtances already, one in the Presbytry of the <hi>Mearnes</hi> who did by a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter intimate the Lord <hi>Arburthnet</hi> (whom they had choſen to be Ruling Elder to the General Aſſembly) that if he had any heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſcruple to declare himſelf ſatisfied with the Publick Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, they behoved to make choice of another: Another in the Presbytery of <hi>Kirkaldy</hi> diſcharging the Ruling Elder choſen for the Town of <hi>Burnt-Iſland,</hi> upon the accompt of his being oppoſit to the Publick Reſolutions. Beſides theſe Reaſons, there be alſo others mentioned and cleared, in the Debate that contribute for proving the nullity of this Aſſembly; and when all theſe are put together, I beleeve it ſhall not be found that there were moe, or more material Reaſons brought by the Aſſembly at <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> for nullifying of any of theſe 6. pretended Aſſemblies, then are brought for nullifying of this; and therefore the Writer hath done no wrong to his credit, nor ſhown himſelf raſh in affirming ſo.</p>

I ſhall add but a word or two more, one is this: I put it to ſome of their conſciences if it was not apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that the Aſſembly would approve the proceedings of the Commiſſioners, together with the occaſion of that dayes event that moved them indeed to give that Proteſtation more then conſcience of any weight of the grounds whereon it was built. I give only theſe two Evidences of this, 1. That they did ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly preſs the Aſſembly to be but adjourned upon that ground, that there were ſuch differences about theſe proceedings. 2. That until that day ſome of themſelves had ſitten and voted in it, as in an Aſſembly lawfully conſtitute, compeared in Committees of the Aſſembly, yea, ſitten as Members in them, ſome of them being Moderators and Clerks of theſe Committees cognoſced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on matters that came before the Aſſembly, made reports to the full Aſſembly, concurred with votes in making ſundry Acts of the Aſſembly, until that very day the blow was given at <hi>Inerkeithen</hi>; and even then when the Aſſembly met at night to adviſe about tranſlation, they voted in that buſineſs; It's true, They voted not for tranſlation, but for adjourning of it: But that ſame did neceſſarily import their acknowledgment of it for the preſent as a lawful Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; however now they do profeſs that that was an error and fault: Yet theſe things do clearly enough evidence, that at the time of the in-giving of be Proteſtation, it was not conſcience of the weight of the grounds whereon it was built (as they pretended in the Proteſtation) but ſome other thing, even that which was ſaid before, that moved them to proteſt againſt the Aſſembly.</p>

                        <p>THe Author is pleaſed handſomly to wave the anſwer brought by the Writer to theſe objections, though many of them be home to the purpoſe: He brings for his Reaſons, that the grounds of the Proteſtation are weak and fectleſs. But the ſentence of one

If there be no more to be ſaid againſt the grounds of the Proteſtation then is in his Vindication, they may haply be found ſtrong enough not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding both of his underminings and batteries: I ſhall the leſs wonder at his big words, to wit, That the Proteſters ſhall never be able to wipe away, before the eyes of impartial men of this and ſucceeding generations, who ſhall be rightly informed of it: The blot of dividing this Kirk and expoſing our Government to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Enemy by needleſs proponing of it; becauſe it is of his intereſt and concernment to put theſe things from his own door and the door of his complices. But in this the Proteſters with much trembling and fear do make their humble appeal to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, deſiring Him in mercy both to the one and to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to bear teſtimony at whoſe door the guilt of theſe things doth mainly lie, whether at theirs who on a ſudden do change both their principles and party, or at theirs who adhering to their former prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples have born teſtimony againſt that change, and have ſtudied, though in much weakneſs and with many failings and infirmities to preſerve their Union <hi>cum Deo, cum Foedere, cum Priſtina Eccleſia Scoticana</hi>; and to preſerve the Liberty of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland [jure]</hi> by proteſtation, when they could not do it <hi>[facto]</hi> by any other lawful means.

had dealt fairly if he had ſet down theſe ſpeeches that gave evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their inſultations, their own breaſts beſt know what was the frame of their ſpirits, and no man under Heaven can bring any evidence of their contentment, or inſultation in their countenance and ſpeech. That they would not delay the in-giving of it, was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe grounds: 1 Becauſe they did perceive they were already put to diſadvantages by delay. 2 Becauſe they did ſuſpect that it was not ſafe for them to go to <hi>Dundee,</hi> which ſuſpition was afterwards verified not to be groundleſs, by the uſage that ſome of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber met with in that place. 3 Becauſe they doubted if the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly ſhould have liberty to tranſport themſelves to ſit elſ-where, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> now being Maſter of the Fields,. That it was given in when it was near midnight, and after the adjournment of the Aſſembly, are no agravating circumſtances of the buſineſs; but the reaſon was, they delaied as long as poſſibly they could, being loth to fall upon this laſt remedy till they have the utmoſt. As for that Queſtion that he puts to the conſciences of the Proteſters, I ſhall give a conſciencious and ingenious Anſwer thereto in both the parts of it, expecting that he will do the like upon Queſtions put to him after this manner. As to the firſt part of it I do indeed think that the apprehenſion, or rather the almoſt certain knowledge, that the Aſſembly would approve the proceedings of the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, had weight with the Proteſters, both to look more narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the lawfulnes and freedom of the Aſſembly, and to think more ſeriouſly upon a Proteſtation then otherwiſe they would have done if the Aſſembly had been like to improve their power (whatever it was) unto Edification: many things may be born with and winked at in legalities and forms, and wayes of proceeding in Judicatures, when their proceedings for the matter are right, which yet may be juſtly cenſurable in themſelves, and which others may be ſtirred up to take notice of by things relating to the matter: But that the apprehenſion of the Aſſemblies approving of the proceedings of the Commiſſion did make them hazard upon a Proteſtation againſt the Aſſembly, upon ſuch grounds as to their conſciences were not weighty and relevant, I will aſſure him is an untruth; they were convinced in their conſciences before the giving in of that Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that theſe grounds were relevant, and their light and convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is from day to day more and more encreaſed in this thing, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it was, and is unto them a matter of great ſadneſs to ſee a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

Aſſembly of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> corrupted in the Conſtitution and actings of it, yet they did, and do look upon it as a wonderful providence of God, that as all the former Aſſemblies that carried on courſes of defect on in this Church, were alſo corrupt in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; So this Aſſembly which did ratifie the Publick Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that do involve a courſe of defection, &amp; make ſundry dangerous and deſtructive Acts, was, as to the Conſtitution of it, unfree and unlawful, and therefore no Aſſembly at all. As to the other part of the Queſtion, That it was the occaſion of that dayes event that moved them to give in that Proteſtation, more then the conſcience of any weight of the grounds whereon it was built. He that is the ſearcher of hearts knows that it was not ſo, and that that dayes event had no influence at all upon the Proteſters in giving in of that Proteſtation, otherwiſe then that the dayes event occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning the adjournment of the Aſſembly from <hi>St. Andrews</hi> did oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion the giving in of that Proteſtation before their riſing, leſt there ſhould not be another opportunity. And to make it to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that it was not the occaſion of that daies event that moved them to give it in, I deſire theſe particulars to be taken notice of: 1 That it was reſolved upon and ſubſcribed 48. hours before there was any report of that daies event at <hi>St. Andrews</hi>; it was ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed upon the Friday, and the report of that event came not till Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day at night late. 2 When it was ſubſcribed, it was earneſtly preſt by ſome, that it might preſently after the ſubſcribing thereof, or the next day without further delay be given in to the Aſſembly: and upon this very reaſon among others, leſt if our Forces ſhould be defeated, before the in-giving of it, it might open the mouths of ſome to ſay, that which is now ſpoken by the Author. If it be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, Why it was then delaied? The reaſon was, becauſe ſome was abſent who had been upon the debate of it, and were like to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it; therefore it was reſolved, that it ſhould be delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed until Monday, till they might be preſent to put to their hands, and that on that day without further delay, it ſhould be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-in without reſpect to any events, yet ſo, as if that the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſhould be adjourned before that time, of which there was a conſtant rumor becauſe of the fear of the approach of a Party of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that it ſhould be given in at the time of the adjour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Aſſembly, and accordingly ſome of the number were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to waite on and to do it upon that exigent.

They did indeed ſit and vote in it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral dayes, but with a Proteſtation oftentimes renewed both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after the chuſing of the Moderator to be heard upon the Conſtitution of the Aſſembly without ſatisfaction, in which they could not acknowledge the Aſſembly. And the reaſon why they did ſit and vote till the day of <hi>Inerkeithing,</hi> was that which I have told already, becauſe they were loath to uſe the laſt remedy, till there was no hope, That any other could be effectual to bring things to any tolerable condition: the Author cannot but remember that there was Conference both upon the Thurſday, and upon the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, betwixt ſome of the Commiſſioners and ſome of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in order to a good underſtanding, and ſome right way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Differences, and preventing of further Diviſions, and of a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der breach; and how much and how earneſtly ſome did with tears preſs the Commiſſioners, that they would be inſtrumental to get the Aſſembly adjourned, and how peremptorily they did refuſe, ſo much as once to ſpeak in it. Their <hi>ſalvo</hi> in the Aſſembly was alſo <hi>ſalvo</hi> enough for them to be in Committees: and for their voting in the adjournment. I have told upon what ground they did it, it doth but at the utmoſt ſay, that they did ſtrain themſelves to the utmoſt, and further then otherwiſe could have been convenient, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till neceſſity forced them to uſe the laſt remedy of Proteſting: From all which it may appear, notwithſtanding of any thing ſaid by the Author to the contrary, That it was the conſcience of the weight of the grounds whereupon it was built, and not that which

In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Vindication, he hath holden forth ſome of them, as acting upon Byaſſed and Self-interſt, and as belying all their great Profeſſion, of reſpect to the Government of this Kirk by their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.

Is then that a good conſequence, an Aſsembly that maketh destructive Acts is null, then its as good a conſequence, a Parliament that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth deſtructive Acts is no Parliament, and a King that maketh deſtructive Acts is no King. The truth is, an Aſsembly that makes wrong Acts diſsenting from the rule it ſhould walk by, Acts not as a lawful Aſsembly ſhould do, nor are theſe Acts made obligatory, or to be obeyed, but yet for all that, it may be a true and lawful Aſſembly, as to the eſsence and being of an Aſsembly, and having lawfull authority as the Parliament <hi>48.</hi> in carrying on the ſinfull En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagment, and many Acts deſtructive to the Commonwealth, and to the ends of Parliament, which people thought themſelves not oblieged to obey, and were afterwards condemned; and yet that Parliament was never denyed to be a lawfull Parliament: It was a diſtinction at that time common and uncontradicted, and for my part I cannot ſee a reaſon why it ſhould not have place in relation to an Aſsembly, that the acts of it may be unlawfull, and yet it ſelf an lawfull Aſsembly. The other reaſon is never a whit more to the purpoſe more then the former; for to let that paſs which he ſaith in the antecedent, that whatever power Commiſſioners of a General Aſsembly have, it is by Commiſsion from, &amp;c. (which deſerves examination) and if he mean that Commiſsioners ſitting

together and voting in a Generall Aſsembly, have only a delegate power, and deputed power ſubordinate to Presbyteries, can hardly be reconciled with ſound Doctrine, concerning Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) yet ſuppoſing it to be ſo, no more follows, but that in ſuch acts as the Aſsembly makes, contrary to the limitations and rules con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein, they may get no obedience, and that ſuch acts may be declined and Proteſted againſt; and indeed the Writer himſelf in his conſequent infers no more but this much, for getting in ſo ſhort bounds what he had proponed as the point to be proven, for theſe are his very words: <hi>For in ſo far as they do any thing contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to this, in ſo far they may be declined, as having no power or authority in doing ſuch things</hi>: Which, what is it elſe but what we have ſaid? But it doth not follow, that becauſe they make acts contrary to the limitation of their Commiſſion, therfore the Aſſembly may be declined and proteſted againſt abſolutly, as not having the being of a lawful free Aſsembly, juſt as becauſe, the members of a Parliament have all their power by Commiſſion from the people of the Land, Commiſſioners of Shires from their Shires, and Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners of Burghs from their Burghs by a temporary election; &amp; as I humbly conceive) Noblement<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

I know there are many differences between theſe Judicatories in other things, but I think the Writer ſhall be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly able to let us ſee a reaſon why the paralel of this ſhould not hold good. This is it that takes away the force of the ſecond ground, for proving the point that was intended, however the impertinency of this ſecond ground as to the point it was intended for, is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered before; and I hope by what hath been ſaid, it is ſufficiently evidenced that the Writer hath brought no new conſiderable reaſon for the nullity of the late Aſſembly, as to the being of a lawfull free Aſsembly, even ſuppoſe ſundry of the acts and conſtitutions were wrong upon the matter (which yet is not granted, and he ſhould have proven and not nakedly affirmed) but hath brought diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to himſelf and the Proteſtation.</p>

                        <p>THe Writer is not poſitive in delivering his own judgement upon this point, that is here ſo much inſiſted upon by the Author, but onely ſaith that it is the opinion or conception of ſome with much appearance of reaſon, and therefore upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſall that this opinion were not well grounded, he hath brought little or no diſadvantage either to himſelf or to the Proteſtation, in alleadging the ſame; yea, I believe he will take it for an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to have the Truth diſcovered unto him, either in this or any other particular,: For my part, I am loath, neither do I intend to fall upon the debate of this queſtion, or to deliver my judgement poſitively therein (becauſe, (if I be not miſtaken) it is a thorny queſtion, and full of difficulties on both hands, yet I cannot but take notice of ſome things that are ſet down by the Author in his large Anſwer to what was ſaid ſhortly by the Writer: Firſt, He tels us that the Writer doth but affirm that the Acts and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Aſſembly are wrong; and that his ſaying is not to be holden for <hi>ſententia lata,</hi> nor is it an Oracle: None ſpeaks Oracles but God, and the Writer takes no more upon him but to ſpeak his opinion as a poor weak man; but I believe the Author knows, that it is not only the opinion of the Writer, and of the Proteſters, and of ſuch Miniſters and Profeſſors as are unſatisfied with the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Aſſembly, but alſo of many others, even of not a few of thoſe who were no oppoſites to the Publick Reſolutions; I have hitherto met with few or none in eſtimation for Piety and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe that doth juſtifie and profeſſe their adherence to all the Acts of that Aſſembly as things tending to Edification, and promoving the work of Reformation in the Land; and ſeeing he is pleaſed to make bold with others, I think he will not offend if I appeal his Conſcience, whether he thinks theſe Acts of that Aſſembly that do relate to the cenſuring of all Miniſters, Expectants, Students, Elders and Profeſſors who do not acknowledge the Conſtitution of that Aſſembly, and ſubmit to the Acts thereof, ſuch Acts as in themſelves tend to the furthering of the work of Reformation, and advancing of Piety and Godlineſſe in the Land. Next, I take notice of that which he ſaith, that ſuppoſing as the Writer doth, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was wrong in the point of forme, that there is nothing in the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:166443:155"/>
matter that will juſtifie the deed of the Proteſters, becauſe they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted againſt the lawfulneſſe of the Aſſembly, when as it had not come to any of theſe Proceedings which the Writer alleadgeth to be wrong on the matter; in this the Author is miſtaken, becauſe the rejecting of relevant exceptions proponed againſt ſundry of the Commiſſioners, both before and after the choſing of the Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor was wrong on the matter, being prejudiciall to the right Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Aſſembly, and a preparative to the juſtifying of the Commiſſioners Proceedings. Thirdly I would have him to know that the Writer by theſe ſome, whom he ſpeaks of, doth not mean any of the Proteſters themſelves, though the Authority of ſome of them be of as great weight in the Proteſtant Churches as any of the Divines of this age, and being prior to the Proteſtation, needs not, nor ought not to be looked upon as the teſtimony of a party, but he means ſom Orthodox Writers, and theſe of chief, not in the Proteſtant Churches, whom (as I conceive) he thought he needed not to name, as having no great purpoſe to inſiſt much upon the buſineſſe: But for the Authors ſatisfaction, and the ſatisfaction of others, I ſhall name ſome, Firſt <hi>Calvin</hi> writing upon the 23. of the <hi>Acts</hi> hath theſe words, <hi>Naſcitur quaeſtio, ſi honore non eſt privandus qui malè officio fungitur, peccavit</hi> Paulus <hi>Pontificem honore ſpolians?

                           </gap>: Firſt, He thinks that it is to open a wide gap to confuſion, inferring that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd conſequence that that Aſſembly is not compleatly conſtitute in the being of an Aſſembly, till all the Acts of it be concluded and ended; and that till it be concluded, no man can acknowledge nor ſubmit to it, but with a reſerve. The reaſon of this conſequence muſt be, becauſe haply in the cloſe they may make an Act wrong upon the matter, which one Act nullifies the Aſſembly, though they had done all other things well, but ſo ſaid not the Writer, neither can any ſuch thing rationally be gathered from his words; the moſt that he inſinuates i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>, that an Aſſembly proceeding wholly wrong upon the matter, or in the moſt ſubſtantiall and materiall things, or in the rules of its conſtitutions of greateſt concernment, or as that ſo far as an Aſſembly proceeds wrong upon the matter, it is ſo far without authority, as appears from his own words in the inference which he makes from the power which the Commiſſioners have committed unto them by their Presbyteries, and from the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that he makes in order to the Aſsembly now in queſtion, to wit, That they having in moſt of all, and the moſt material of their proceeding proceeded contrary to the truſt committed unto them by Presbyteries; It furniſheth another conſiderable reaſon for decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them. Secondly, He thinks that it will alſo infer the nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Presbyteries, and make Miniſters no Miniſters, if they ſhall proceed wrong upon the matter, which no man will not ſee to be contrary to the practice of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, in relation to the Prieſts and Church-Judicatories among the Jewes whilſt they were a Church. But to ſay nothing of the difference between Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, Parliaments, and Aſsemblies, the one being ordinary and fixed; the other not ſo, the moſt that it would infer would be this, That in ſo far as they proceed wrong, or that if in the moſt ſubſtantiall and materiall parts of their duty, they proceed wrong upon the matter, their authority is not to be acknowledged, and this ſeems not a very dangerous conſequence. Thirdly, He thinks this contrary to the judgment of the Aſsembly of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> concerning which he thinks it remarkable, that in declaring
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:166443:156"/>
the nullity of ſome preceding Aſsemblies, they do never take an Argument from the matter to prove the nullity of them, whilſt yet (ſaith he) there was very fair occaſion to have done it, if that the Aſſembly had been in the Writers mind. The Writer hath not yet poſitively declared his mind in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: But the Author upon ſecond thoughts will find his remark concerning the Aſsembly of <hi>Glaſgow</hi> not well grounded, becauſe that Aſsembly in proving the nullity of ſome preceding Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, do reaſon not only from the form, but alſo from the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or grounds of their proceeding in their Acts, as appears in the laſt reaſon brought for nullifying the Aſsembly at <hi>Pearth,</hi> which is this, That the ground of their proceeding was not the Word of God, the Confeſſion of Faith, and Acts of former Generall Aſsem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, but the Kings Commandment onely. For the queſtion was thus ſtated, whether the Five Articles in reſpect of his Majeſties Commandment ſhould paſs in Act or not, as the Records of that pretended Aſsembly bear, where it is declared; <hi>That for the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and reſpect which they bear to his Majeſties Royal Command, they do agree to the foreſaid Articles.</hi> And that the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> had reſpect to the matter as well as to the form, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulling theſe Aſſemblies, is manifeſt from that notable Act at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinburgh,</hi> in the year 1639. concerning the cauſes and remedies of the bygone evils of this Kirk, in which the fifth Cauſe is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be the keeping and authorizing corrupt Aſſemblies at <hi>Lith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow</hi> 1606 and 16<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To that part of the Authors Reply which concerns the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons brought by the Writer, to wit, that Kirk-Judicatories have no power for deſtruction, but that all their power is for edification, and that whatſoever power the Commiſſioners of a Generall Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie have, it is by Commiſſion from their Presbyteries; which Commiſſion limits them to the Word of God, and to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and to Acts of former Generall Aſſemblies. I anſwer theſe few things: Firſt, That he layes more upon the Writer, than the Writer doth aſſert or inſinuate either as his own judgment, or the judgment of others, he hath neither ſaid nor inſinuate, that the making of ſome wrong Acts, doth make an Aſſembly null; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I think that he would ſay or inſinuate any thing of this
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:166443:157"/>
kind; he did as little deny the authority of the Parliament 48, as any other. But if there be no difference between the Aſſembly and the Parliament in theſe caſes, and that no reaſon can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven why it ſhould not have place in relation to the one as well as to the other, I ſhall deſire him to reconcile his judgment with <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> his <hi>Aliquid Diſcriminis,</hi> and with <hi>Pareus</hi> his <hi>Magna Diſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudo.</hi> The Author knowes that the Civill Power is Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectonick and Deſpotick; the Eccleſiaſtick but Hyperetick or Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conick; the one Lordly, the other but ſtewardly and meerly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall. The other reaſon (if we may believe the Author) is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a whit nearer to the purpoſe then the former; for (ſuch he) to let paſs what he ſaith in the antecedent. That what ever power Commiſſioners of a Gen. Aſſembly have, it is by Commiſſion, &amp;c. which deſerves examination, and if he mean that Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners ſitting together, and voting in a Generall Aſſembly, have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a delegated and deputed power ſubordinate to Presbyteries, can hardly be reconciled with ſound doctrine concerning Church-Government, yet ſuppoſing it to be ſo, no more followes, but that in ſuch Acts as the Aſſembly makes contrary to the limitations and rules contained therein, they may get no obedience, and that ſuch Acts may be declined and proteſted againſt, &amp;c. The Author doth here grant, that the Writer infers no more but this much, forgetting (as he ſaith) in ſo ſhort bounds what he intended to prove. It will be hard to make it appear that the Writer did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to prove any more: The Author may ſtrain that indefinite expreſſion of his, an Aſſembly proceeding wrong upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as though he had meant, that the leaſt wrong Act in the leaſt thing, did make an Aſſembly null, though to the conſtitution and Acts of it in all things elſe it were never ſo right: But ſo abſurd an aſſertion can hardly be ſuppoſed to have entred in the thoughts of any rationall mau; and I think it is clear from the reaſon, that he bring, that this is not his meaning, becauſe he ſays that Church-Judicatories have no power to deſtruction, but all their power is to edification; in theſe things then in which they imploy their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to edification, and make right Acts (having other neceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites of lawfull conſtitution) they are not null, nor to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined. The Author in repeating that reaſon tells us, that that which is ſaid by the Writer, to wit, <hi>What ever power Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of a Generall Aſſembly have, it is by Commiſsion from the
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:166443:158"/>
Presbyteries,</hi> doth deſerve examination; I wiſh he had alſo told us what ſtumbles him in this; as for that which he ſuſpects to be the Writers meaning, that Commiſsioners ſitting together, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in a Generall Aſsembly, have onely a delegated and depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted power ſubordinate to Presbyteries, there is no cauſe to ſuſpect him of ſuch a meaning, as that there being nothing in his words that look that way. I alſo wiſh, that the Author in repeating of the Writers Argument had made mention not onely of limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and rules in generall contained in the Commiſſion of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries, but of the particular limitations and rules ſpecified by the Writer, that is, the Word of God, the Covenant, and Acts of former Generall Aſſemblies, becauſe it is not upon the breach of limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and rules ſimply, but upon the breach of theſe limitations and rules ſet down in their Commiſſion that the Writer layes weight.

argument had been a Cavillation; for neither did follow neceſsari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ſuppoſed, there was a third, a Church univocally ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>id eſt,</hi> a Church right conſtitute, and doing dutie though not unerrable in it ſelf.</p>

                        <p>THe firſt thing the Author takes notice of in his Anſwer to this Objection, is that which is ſaid by the Writer, that the Act of the Aſſembly 1582. alleadged for the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary excommunication of theſe who decline the Gen. Aſſembly is groſly miſtaken, it being nothing againſt declining lawful or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Aſsemblies, to which he retorts that the Writer is as groſſely miſtaken, whileſt he inſinuats that ſuch as ſpeak for the late Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do mean that ſuch an Act ſhould be againſt declining any Aſſem. null or unlawfull. Wel then, ſuppoſing the Writer to have been groſly miſtaken in the writing of ſuch a thing, and that a wrong conſtitute and erring Aſſembly, or onely wrong conſtituted, is no otherways an Aſsem. then as a painted man is a man (as the Author ſpeaks) afterwards, and that the Aſſem. at St. <hi>Andrews</hi> &amp; <hi>Dundee</hi> is but an unlawful Aſſembly, wrong in the Conſtitution (as is proven) and erring in its Acts, then might it warrantably have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined and proteſted againſt, notwithſtanding of that Act 1582. or that Act 1638 or any other act of any of the Aſſemblies of this Kirk, as the ſix corrupt Aſſemblies upon the ſame reaſons, upon which they were afterward repealed, might in the time when they were ſitting have been warrantably proteſted againſt, as ſome other Aſsemblies which are inſtanced by the Writer, and paſt by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in ſilence were proteſted againſt; and ſo all the debate that was in the Meeting at <hi>Dundee</hi> for making uſe of theſe Acts againſt the Proteſters, was groundleſſe and without warrant: But the Writer is not ſo groſly miſtaken as the Author gives out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath paſt current, and doth ſtill ſtick with not a few, that the Acts of a Generall Aſſembly could not be proteſted againſt, much leſſe the Conſtitution thereof, though culpable and wrong, and the Author himſelf ſeems to come near the borders of it: That an Aſſembly cannot be well proteſted againſt in regard of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:166443:160"/>
though wrong, when in the ſame Vindication where he comes to weigh the reaſons whereupon the Proteſtation is built, he ſaith, That where a Generall Aſſembly it ſelf is proteſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt as unlawfull, and having no authority, who ſees not how ſad the conſequences moſt readily be in that Kirk, hardly can it by any outward meanes but turn to a fixed ſchiſme, which thing godly orthodox Chriſtians in all ages of the Kirk have deteſted and abhorred, chooſing rather ever to tolerate great offences which they did ſee, but could not amend, then to divide the Church of Chriſt: I know that he may ſay that he means not here of an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly wrong in its conſtitution; but if ſo, what commodious ſenſe in reference to that which he is ſpeaking of, to wit, proteſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Gen. Aſſembly will he put upon the reſt of his words, concerning godly mens tolerating great offences, rather then to divide the Church, an Aſſembly right in its conſtitution is no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, much leſſe a great offence. He doth not deny that there was a debate at the Aſſembly at <hi>Dundee,</hi> concerning the ſummary excommunication of theſe who had proteſted, but tels us that it was not great nor long (If ſome who were preſent may be believed) it was proſecuted by ſundry with a great deal of earneſtneſſe and forwardneſſe, and though the Author (if I miſtake him not) was none of the proſecuters of it; yet it ſeems by his Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that his judgement is, That they might not onely have debated it, but alſo have done it by the conſtitutions of this Kirk, if they would have minded ſeverity of cenſure, but it would have contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute ſomewhat for clearing of the Aſſembly in that debate, and for ſatisfying of others anent his judgement upon the point, if he had brought any act or conſtitution of this Kirk, that would have born the weight of ſummary excommunication againſt the Proteſters, for the Writer hath made it clearly to appear that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the act 1582. nor the act 1638. doth at all meet with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſters caſe, and the Author hath replyed nothing to the differences of the caſes, and therefore they may be ſtill taken as granted, what act the meeting at Dundee did in their debate look unto, whether that of 82 or that of 38. themſelves beſt know, but if it was the Act of the Aſſembly at <hi>Glaſgow</hi> (as the Author ſaith) upon which they had their eye, the Writer hath ſhewed how that could not with any ſhadow of reaſon be applyed to this caſe. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>declinator
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:166443:160"/>
of the Biſhops 38. ſtriking at the eſsentiall conſtitution of the Government, and againſt the rule it ſelf; and that of the Proteſters acknowledging the government and the rule, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting onely againſt the conſtitution, becauſe not agreeable to the rule. It ſeems that all that they had their eyes upon was, that they found in the act of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> that proteſting againſt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining of the Aſſembly was by the acts of this Kirk cenſurable with ſummary excommunication, but ſhould they not have found what the acts were, and whether they were applicable to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe: The Author grants that it could not be gotten tryed whether it doth mean 1582. or ſome others for want of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters, which were then in the Baſs; I ſhall not ſay that this is ſome evidence that the members of that meeting were not very well acquainted with the acts of the Aſsemblies of this Church, and that it had not been much amiſs for them to have read and peruſed theſe acts of Aſsemblies which were offered unto them a little after their down ſitting under their Clerks hand, concerning the Publick Reſolutions: If my information fail me not, a good part of the Regiſters, particularly the great Book of the old acts of the Aſsemblies, in which that act of the Aſsembly 1582. is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, was then in <hi>Dundee,</hi> in the hand of their then Clerk, who took ſome pains to find out that act, but could not fall upon it: It may haply ſeem ſtrange to ſome, that becauſe they found theſe words which (to wit, declining and Proteſting againſt the Aſsembly) <hi>by the Acts of the Aſſembly is cenſurable with ſummary excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication</hi> in an act of an Aſsembly at <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> that they will have ſuch reſpects there to, without looking upon theſe acts, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering their grounds, or extent, thence to infer that theſe acts were applicaple to this caſe; this were to defer more reſpect to the authority of that grave Aſsembly then was fit, or they themſelves would have taken with, if they had been ſitting; for they did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without viewing and peruſing the Regiſters themſelves, and proving and clearing every thing thereby, that they did alleadge therefrom, which Vindicates that Aſſembly ſufficiently from the abſurdities here alleadged by the Writer againſt theſe who alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch an act. The Author thinks that the Writer is in a great miſtake in his <hi>dilemma,</hi> but let us ſee what his miſtake is: The wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter anſwering a common alleadgance, that there is an act of a Gen.
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:166443:161"/>
Aſſembly appointing ſuch as decline the Aſſembly to be ſummari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excommunicated, denyes that ever the Church in any of her Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies made any ſuch act in ſo generall and unlimited termes; and he gives this for a reaſon of his denyall, that from hence it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, either that they thought that an Aſſembly could not be wrong in its conſtitutions, and could not erre, or elſe that though wrong in conſtitution, or erring, that they could not be proteſted againſt; both which he ſaith is abſurd: To this the Author anſwers, that conſidering that the act appointing ſuch to be ſummarily excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, is intended only againſt proteſting againſt, and decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a Generall Aſſembly, not in any particular acts or act there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of which he confeſſes may be Proteſted againſt, but againſt the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry being of it, as null in it ſelf, and having no authority; there is no neceſſity either of the one ſuppoſition or of the other follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it; not of the latter, &amp;c. But firſt to paſſe by, that he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in all this debate to ſuppoſe that there is ſuch an act in ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and unlimited termes which I believe ſhall not be found, nor doth the words of the act of the Aſſembly 38. ſay or ſuppoſe any ſuch thing. It deſerves conſideration, which he ſaith, that that act concerning the excommunicating ſuch as proteſt againſt, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline an Aſſembly, is intended onely againſt thoſe who proteſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the being of an Aſſembly, and not in any particular act or acts thereof, becauſe as the Writer told him, the act 1582. which is the onely, act relating to that buſineſſe (ſo far as I know, or can be informed by theſe who take moſt pains in the Records of the Aſſemblies) is not anent declining Aſſemblies, in their being and conſtitution, but againſt appealing from lawfull acts of lawful Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies to the Civill Magiſtrate in Eccleſiaſtick cauſes, for ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Eccleſiaſtick Diſcipline. Secondly, though an Aſſembly wrong conſtitute and erring both, or onely wrong conſtitute be no otherwayes an Aſſembly then a painted man is a man, that it is not really or truly, but ſeemingly only, yet it being ſeemingly an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, it gets ordinarily and in common expreſſion, that denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and as a painted man drawen by the hand of a cunning Painter may deceive theſe who have not diſcerning eyes, and be taken for a true man, ſo an Aſſembly wrong in the conſtitution and acts, or in the conſtitution onely, may by the vermilion of fair pretext put upon it paſſe with many for a true Aſſembly; yea, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:166443:161"/>
way of expreſſion, an Aſſembly which hath any thing of the colour or ſhadow of the being of a lawfull and right proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Aſſembly is called an Aſſembly, though wrong in its conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or alſo erring in its acts, and therefore to have ſaid ſimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in an act, that decliners of a Generall Aſſembly without any qualification, lawfull, or unlawfull, erring or unerring, or any thing in the act inſinuating or expreſſing the ſame ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, it would follow, that though an Aſſembly ſhould be wrong conſtitute and erre in its Proceedings, yet it could not be declined. As to the third, to paſſe by that the Generall Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly at St. <hi>Andrews</hi> and <hi>Dundee</hi> is none of theſe Aſſemblies, but an Aſsembly wrong both in its conſtitutions, and in its acts, The Act if it were ſo generall as that cited and anſwered by the VVriter, it would ſuppoſe more then any of theſe, to wit, a Generall Aſsembly which is onely ſuch, <hi>nomine tenus</hi> and <hi>ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum apparentiam</hi> in regard of its conſtitution, and a Generall Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly right upon the conſtitution, and erring wholly even in the thing of greateſt conſequence upon the matter; as to this <hi>ſimile</hi> of his brought from the words of Chriſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 18. It doth not hold, becauſe Chriſt never maintained it to be unlawfull to decline any Church, true or falſe, as theſe whom the VVriter ſpeaks of in his objection. The truth is, that the VVriter meant of propounding and anſwering that objection, to remove a groſs miſtake that hath been ordinary in the mouths of many; that a Generall Aſsembly could not be declined nor proteſted againſt, becauſe of an act of an Aſsembly appointing ſuch to be ſummarily excommunicate which in the common conſtruction that paſt upon it was ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, that whoſoever upon whatſoever ground did proteſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Generall Aſsembly of this Church, or any of the acts thereof right or wrong, were by the acts of the Aſsembly ſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to be excommunicated, which miſtake the VVriter ſtudieth to take off, by holding torch the abſurd conſequences, that would have followed upon ſuch an act, as that thereby to make it appear that there is no ſuch act in ſo abſolute and il-limited termes as will reach theſe who proteſt againſt Aſsemblies wrong in their conſtitution, or alſo erring in their acts, and this being gained, he hath all that he did intend to prove and hold forth in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>

                  <p>AS we cannot but with ſad hearts regrate that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the many endeavors of, and great pains taken by the Parliament and Committee of Eſtates, for removing of Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, and offering all juſt ſatisfaction to the Deſires of the Commiſſioners of the General Aſſembly concerning the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and lawfulneſs of this preſent Engagement; yet they have all hitherto proven ineffectual, and Diviſions betwixt us are rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, then leſſened; ſo we cannot but here promiſe to our ſelves better Succeſs from the wiſdom of this grave and venerable Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, eſpecially whilſt our conſciences bears us witneſs, that in all our undertakings we have nothing before our eyes but the glory of God in the firſt place; and in the ſecond, the good and preſervation of Religion; and next therunto, the ſafety of his Majeſties Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon now in danger, and the purſuance of the ſame ends of our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which hath been ſealed with the blood of ſo many of our friends and country men: And that our ſincerity and reallity in all theſe may be manifeſted to all the world, we are content now again at this time, not only to renew all theſe offers which were former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made by the Parliament to the Commiſſioners of the Gen. Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, for the ſecurity of Religion; but hereby we offer to grant what further ſecurity the General Aſſembly ſhall be pleaſed to demand in reaſon of us for Religion: And although we cannot lay nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and reſtrictions on the King, but muſt as obliged in conſcience and duty, endeavor his Reſcue, that he may come with honor, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſafety to ſome of his Houſes, in, or about <hi>London</hi>; yet we are moſt willing to give what Aſſurance can be demanded for our ſelves and our Army, even by an ſolemn Oath, if ſo it ſhall be thought fit by the General Aſſembly, that we ſhall not be ſatisfied and lay down Arms, until Religion be ſecured in all his Majeſties Dominions, according to the Covenant: Therfore out of the deep ſenſe we have of the great danger that the further growth of theſe Diviſions may bring to Religion, the Kings Majeſty, and to theſe who doth ſincerly wiſh the ſettling of Presbiterial Government in all his Majeſties Dominions. We cannot but deſire you ſeriouſly to weigh the ſad Conſequences may enſue, if at this time there be not

Aſſembly, We do deſire that ye would be pleaſed to forbear the emitting of any Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on either to this Kingdom, or the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> relating to our preſent Engagement and proceedings, conſidering how unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable it may prove whilſt our Army is in the Fields againſt the great obſtructions of any Enemies to our Reformation, to do any thing may encourage and ſtrengthen the hands and hearts of that — who doubtleſs will encourage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their own wayes, the more they have ours diſapproven by you: And as their unhappy differences and diviſions have already ſo wrought upon the hollow hearts of ſome of our Countrymen, as to move them to riſe in Arms againſt the Parliaments Forces, and of ſome to run and joyn themſelves with theſe — ſo much the more wil theſe — be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and encouraged againſt us by their hearing of our Diviſions: We do likewiſe deſire, That before the Gen.

                  <p>THe chief cauſe of many evils which have befallen this Church in time of defection under Prelacie being clearly determined by the Gen: Aſſembly at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> 1639. to have been the <hi>keeping and authorizing</hi> corrupt Generall Aſſemblies, it is of high concernment, that we take heed that we be not conſenting nor concurring to the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and authorizing ſuch Aſſemblies in this declining time amongſt which the Aſſembly indicted by the Commiſſioners of the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Aſſembly at St. <hi>Andrews</hi> and <hi>Dundee,</hi> is to be reckoned, and conſequently ought not to be keeped by any who have proteſted againſt, or are in their conſciences unſatisfied with the Publick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions and Acts of the Aſsembly at <hi>Dundee,</hi> eſtabliſhing the ſame as involving defection and backſliding from the Cauſe of God and Covenant.</p>

<pb n="299" facs="tcp:166443:169"/>
the Aſsembly of <hi>Dundee,</hi> the enſuing Aſsembly is conſtitute by a corrupt rule: <hi>Ergo,</hi> The major Propoſition is unqueſtionable, the minor is proved thus: It is to be conſtituted by the Acts of the pretended Aſsembly of <hi>Dundee</hi> as by a rule: <hi>Ergo,</hi> By a corrupt rule; the antecedent is manifeſt, becauſe all the unrepealed Acts of former Aſsemblyes that do determine the qualification of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, are eſpecially the Acts of the Aſſem. immediatly prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, are the rule by which the Aſsem. is to be conſtituted, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt from the Acts of the Aſsem. themſelvs, old and late, and from the conſtant practice of this Kirk in all her Aſsemblies, and that the Acts of <hi>Dundee</hi> include a corrupt rule as to the judgements and conſciences of thoſe who condemn theſe Acts as involving a courſe of defection, is manifeſt, becauſe they appoint all thoſe who do not acquieſce and is obedient to the Acts and Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that Aſsembly, to be proceeded againſt with the cenſures of the Kirk, and ſo to be excluded from being capable of being ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted as Commiſſioners for ſitting in the Aſsembly as Members rightly qualified.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. No man ought to concur in any Election of Commiſſioners when the Election is not free, but ought rather to give teſtimony againſt the ſame: But the Election of Commiſſioners to the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly indicted by the pretended authority of the Commiſſioners of the Aſsembly at <hi>Dundee</hi> cannot be free in the judgement of theſe who do not approve of the Acts of <hi>Dundee; Ergo,</hi> Nothing here needs confirmation but the Aſsumption, which may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thus; That Election which is limited and reſtricted unto ſuch only as are involved in a courſe of defection and back-ſliding, and is excluſive of all other who have not been involved in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid courſe, cannot be a free election, but the election of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsioners of the enſuing Aſsembly is ſuch, in the judgement of theſe who do not approve the Acts of <hi>Dundee; Ergo,</hi> The reaſon of the aſſumption is, becauſe <hi>illud poſsumus quod jure poſsumus.</hi> Now, no Presbyterie, Seſsion, or perſon acknowledging the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and authority of the Aſſem. of <hi>Dundee,</hi> and yet teſtifying againſt the Acts thereof relating to the approbation of Publick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, and to the cenſuring of the oppoſers, and ſuch as do not acquieſce and give obedience thereto, can legally chooſe Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, contrary to a ſtanding unrepealed Act of an Aſſembly. Therefore the election of Commiſsioners to the enſuing Aſſembly
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:166443:170"/>
muſt be limited and unfree in the judgments of theſe who proteſt againſt it in their conſciences, or diſ-approve the Acts of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of <hi>Dundee,</hi> as involving the approbation of the courſe of defection.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. No man ought concur in the election of Commiſsioners to an Aſſembly, unto which none are to be admitted Members, but ſuch as are involved in a courſe of defection and back ſliding from the Cauſe of God, and from the Covenant, but the enſuing Aſſembly is to be ſuch in the judgements of theſe who diſ-approve the Acts of <hi>Dundee; Ergo,</hi> the Propoſition is granted on all hands, even the Aſſembly of <hi>Dundee,</hi> and the aſſerters of the authority thereof, grant the Nullity of an Aſſembly, when the authors and abettors of a courſe of defection are admitted to be conſtituent members.

                  </p>

abundantly proved by the clearing of theſe things: 1. That en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting the drawing forth of cenſures of the Church againſt godly man, (to ſpeak nothing of that which is already executed) for that which is no fault in them, is the enacting of a perſecution of godly men, cannot be denyed by any. 2. That the enacting to draw forth all the cenſures of the Kirk againſt theſe who do not approve the Acts and Conſtitutions of the Aſſembly of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee,</hi> to the enacting of drawing forth cenſures againſt godly men, for that which is no fault in them, but duty, is unqueſtionable in the judgment of theſe who diſ-approve theſe Acts. 3. That the Aſsembly now indicted, is to be made up of ſuch, is cleare from what is before ſpoken, and ſhall be further cleared immediatly.</p>
                  <p>Ob. <hi>How doth it appear that the Aſsembly now indicted, is to be conſtituted, as all theſe reaſons do import, can we judge of the conſtitution of it before we ſee how it is conſtituted?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It muſt be conſtituted according to the acts and rules conſtituting, which are not yet repealed, and therefore according to rules of the Aſſembly at <hi>Dundee,</hi> in the judgment of theſe who acknowledge the authority of that Aſſembly, and theſe acts can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be repealed before the conſtitution of another Aſſembly. 2. That it muſt be ſo conſtitute, may appear from the tenaciouſneſs of Synods and Presbyteries, to maintain the authority and acts of that pretended Aſſembly, who being involved in the approbation of the ſame, have given good evidence, that the enſuing Aſſembly muſt be ſo conſtitute, if it be urged as for inſtance the Letter of the inſtant Commiſſioners, which doth appoint the place of meeting of the future Aſſembly, do deſire Presbyteries to chooſe Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners according to the known and ordinary rules of election; but theſe know and ordinary rules cannot be ſuppoſed to include the acts of the Aſſembly at <hi>Dundee</hi>: 1. Becauſe theſe acts are not known, the ſame not being publiſhed, yea not extant, neither can they be called ordinary, being once onely done, and being queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned much by many, it is anſwered, Theſe are poor ſhifts: 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe acts were formally concluded and voted, and do yet ſtand unrepealed. 2. Becauſe if the authority of the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on who wrote this Letter, ought to be acknowledged and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto, then ought theſe acts which flow from the ſame autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to be acknowledged and ſubmitted unto. 3. Theſe acts are publick, and in the hands of the Presbyteries up and down the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:166443:171"/>
Land, and regiſtrated in ſundry of their Books, as alſo in the Books of ſome Synods; and ſome Presbyteries have proceſſed ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons upon theſe acts, and they cannot be excluded from the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary rule, becauſe but once done, becauſe the meaning of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary rule in this place muſt be, that theſe onely are ro be elected, when no ſtanding act of the Kirk doth exclude, and yet it doth not make it ceaſe to be a rule, ſo long as the authority of the Aſſembly ſtands, and the act it ſelf ſtands unrepealed, how much ſoever it be queſtioned by ſome.</p>
                  <p>Ob. <hi>But we may probably ſuppoſe, that the Acts of the Aſſembly of</hi> Dundee, <hi>ſhall not be tenaciouſly ſtuck to in the constitution of the Aſsembly now indicted, but that Proteſters againſt the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution or Acts at</hi> Dundee, <hi>ſhal be admitted as Members in the conſtitution of this Aſsembly.</hi>

Probably that may be the judgement of ſome godly and moderate brethren; but how few ſuch are to be found, and how unequall to carry it ſo, againſt many that are otherwayes minded. 2.

How improbable is that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the temper of the late Meeting at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the 12. of <hi>May,</hi> the inſtructions given by Synods to ſuch as were ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under a pretence of endeavouring the Union of the Church, but really to carry on a deſigne to have an Aſſembly depending on the authority of the pretended Aſſem. of <hi>Dundee,</hi> and conſtitute as that was, and conſidering the articles that came from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> that no Union could be, except the authority, conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, acts, cenſures and Commiſſions iſſued from the ſaid Aſsem. be acknowledged by all, and the Declinator paſt from, which articles are magnified by theſe men, and ſome Synods have not been ſo cautious as others to keep back a Synodicall inſtruction, to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in order to an Union, without the advice aforeſaid. 4. If ſuch a conceſſion had been intended how eaſie had it been to the pretended Commiſsion that takes upon them to indict this Aſsem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to have given ſome ground in their Letters to expect it, and not to have wrapt the rule of elections in ambiguous words, to ſay no

Suppoſe a poſsibility of conſtituting the Aſsembly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwayes nor according to the acts at <hi>Dundee</hi>; yet how can any that have born teſtimony againſt the Publick Reſolutions and acts ratifying the ſame as involving defection, ſit with the authors and promoters of that courſe, and not propone that exception which is on all hands acknowledged to be relevant, and that ſuch as are guilty of it, ought not to be admitted to ſit in an Aſsembly; or if it be propounded, how ſhall it be ſatisfied once there is ſuch diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of judgment about that matter.</p>

people of old, who in the time of their troubls, and when they were to ſeek delivery and a right way for themſelvs, that the Lord might be with them to proſper them, did humble themſelves before him, and make a free and particular confeſſion of the ſins of their Princes, their Rulers, their Captains, their Prieſts and their People, and did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage themſelves to do no more ſo, but to reform their wayes, and be ſtedfaſt in his Covenant; and remembring the practiſe of our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors in the year 1596. wherein the Gen.

And becauſe it is needful for theſe who find mercy not only to confeſs, but alſo to forſake their Sin; therefore that the reality and ſincerity of our repentance may appear, We do reſolve, and ſolemnly engage our ſelves before the Lord, carefully to avoid for the time to come all theſe offences, whereof we have now made ſolemn pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Acknowledgment, and all the ſnares and tentations which tend thereunto: And to teſtifie the integrity of our reſolution herein, and that we may be the better enabled in the power of the Lords ſtrength to perform the ſame, we do again renew our ſolemn League and Covenant, promiſing hereafter to make conſcience of all the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties whereunto we are obliged in all the heads and Articles there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, particularly of theſe which follow:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe Religion is of all things the moſt excellent and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, the advancing and promoving the power thereof againſt all ungodlineſs and profanity, the ſecuring and preſerving the purity thereof againſt all error, hereſie, and ſchiſm; and namely, <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency, Anabaptiſm, Antinomianiſm, Arminianiſm, Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm, Familiſm, Libertiniſm, Scepticiſm,</hi> and <hi>Eraſtianiſm,</hi> and the carrying on the work of uniformity ſhall be ſtudied and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by us before all wordly intereſt, whether concerning the King, or our ſelves, or any other whatſoever. 2. Becauſe many have of late labored to ſupplant the liberties of the Kirk, we ſhall maintain and defend the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in all her liberties and priviledges, againſt all who ſhall oppoſe or undermine the ſame, or encroach thereupon under any pretext whatſoever. 3. We ſhall vindicate &amp; maintain the liberties of the Subjects in all theſe things which concern their conſciences, perſons and Eſtates. 4. We ſhall carefully maintain and defend the union betwixt the Kingdoms, and avoid every thing that may weaken the ſame, or involve us in any meaſure of acceſſion unto the guilt of thoſe who have invaded the Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi> 5. As we have been alwaies loyal to our King, ſo we ſhall ſtill endeavour to give unto God that which is
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:166443:176"/>
Gods, and to <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things which are <hi>Caeſars.</hi> 6. We ſhall be ſo far from conniving at, complying with, or countenancing of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignancy, injuſtice, iniquity, prophanity, and impiety, that we ſhall not only avoid, and diſcountenance thoſe things, and cheriſh and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage theſe perſons, who are zealous for the Cauſe of God, and walk according to the Goſpel; But alſo ſhall take a more effectual courſe then heretofore in our reſpective Places and Callings, for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing and ſuppreſſing theſe evils, and faithfully endeavor that the beſt and fitteſt remedies may be applied for taking away the cauſes thereof, and advancing the knowledge of God, and Holineſs and Righteouſneſs in the Land. And therefore in the laſt place, as we ſhall earneſtly pray unto God, That he would give us <hi>able men fearing God, men of truth, and hating Covetouſneſs,</hi> to judge and bear charge among his people, ſo we ſhall according to our Places and Callings, endeavor that Judicatories and all places of Power and Truſt both in Kirk and State may conſiſt of, and be filled with ſuch men as are of known good affection to the Cauſe of God, and of a blameleſs and Chriſtian converſation.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe there may be many, who heretofore have not made conſcience of the Oath of God, but ſome through fear, others by perſwaſion, and upon baſe ends, and humane intereſts, have entered therunto, who have afterwards diſcovered themſelves to have dealt deceitfully with the Lord in ſwearing falſly by his name, Therefore we who do now renew our Covenant in reference to theſe duties and all other duties contained therin, Do in the ſight of him who is the ſearcher of hearts, ſolemnly profeſs, That it is not upon any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick advantage, or private intereſt, or by-end, or becauſe of any ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror or perſwaſion from men, or hypocritically and deceitfully, that we do again take upon us the Oath of God, But honeſtly and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerly, and from the ſence of our duty, and that therefore denying our ſelves and our own things, and laying aſide all ſelf intereſt and ends, We ſhall above all things ſeek the honor of God, the good of his Cauſe, and the wealth of his people, and that forſaking the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of fleſh and blood, and not leaning upon carnal confidences, we ſhall depend upon the Lord, walk by the rule of his word, and hearken to the voice of his ſervants: In all which profeſſing our own weakneſs, We do earneſtly pray to God, who is the Father of mercies, through his Son Jeſus Chriſt, to be merciful unto us, and to enable us by the power of his might, that we may do our duty unto the praiſe of his Grace in the Churches. <hi>Amen.</hi>
